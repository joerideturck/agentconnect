## 1. Component Structure and Responsibilities

This chapter summarizes the daemon's **modules and their responsibilities**. Every later chapter expands one or more of them. A daemon is a **self-contained "message ingress + agent execution" unit**: platform integration, local routing, ACP driving, tool injection, scheduled triggers, and degraded autonomy form a closed loop **inside one process**. The WebSocket to the Control Plane carries control traffic and bounded, authorized BFF reads; live platform messages and ACP updates stay off that connection.

### 1.1 Three Process Relationships (Establish the Boundaries First)

| Relationship                       | Protocol                                       | Payload                                                     | Details      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| daemon <-> Control Plane           | WebSocket + JSON, initiated outbound by daemon | Control/telemetry plus bounded on-demand daemon-local reads | section 10   |
| daemon <-> IM platform             | Platform-native API, such as Slack Socket Mode | User messages; edge-connected data-plane loop               | sections 6/9 |
| ACP Host <-> ACP adapter <-> model | ACP, JSON-RPC 2.0 over **stdio**               | Prompt / streaming updates / files / permissions            | section 7    |
| ACP adapter <-> injected tools     | MCP, JSON-RPC over stdio                       | Tool calls such as sendMessage                              | section 9.4  |

> Most daemon modules are **in-process modules** sharing memory and an event bus. Only the ACP adapter/model runs as a **local child process** over stdio. ACP and MCP are therefore local protocols, not network protocols.

### 1.4 Control Plane Components Used by the Daemon

The daemon does not implement these, but interacts with them through the section 10 WebSocket frames. See the upstream designs for CP internals.

- **Orchestrator:** Sends orchestration commands such as `route/assign`, `agent/upsert`, `agent/stop`, `cron/upsert`, and `daemon/drain`; uses daemon load/health for placement and scaling.
- **Registry & Auth:** Daemon registration and health records, capabilities, and **API-key** authentication, rotation, and revocation; see [daemon-api-key-auth.md](daemon-api-key-auth.md).
- **Secrets Service** (future): Delivers platform credentials on demand; not connected in the current version, as noted in section 3.3.

## 2. Daemon as a CLI Program and Persistent System Process

### 2.1 Form

`agentconnect`, optionally shortened to `acd` for AgentConnect Daemon, is a **single executable CLI**. It can run in the foreground for development/debugging or be installed as a persistent launchd/systemd service. Package it as an `npm bin` with optional `pkg` / container images. It starts ACP adapters on demand through `spawn` (`execa`).

> The **OS service manager owns lifecycle**: macOS launchd or Linux systemd `--user`. Do not use an application-managed detached child + PID file. After `install-service` writes the unit, `up`, `down`, and `restart` operate the system service directly. Crash restart and boot start belong to the service manager. Use `run` for foreground development or a container entrypoint. Redirect logs uniformly to `~/.agentconnect/logs/daemon.log`. System-service management is not supported on `win32`; `pickController` throws an explicit error directing the user to `run`.

### 2.2 Subcommands

| Command                             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agentconnect run [--agent <name>]` | Run the daemon in the **foreground** for development or as container PID 1. By default, run all `active` agents under `--agents-dir`. `--agent <name>` runs the single agent whose `id == <name>`, ignoring `status`, with no extra configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `agentconnect up`                   | Start an **installed system service** using launchd `bootstrap` or systemd `--user enable --now`. If not installed, exit nonzero and suggest `install-service` or `run`. Renamed from `start`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `agentconnect down`                 | Stop the installed service using launchd `bootout` or systemd `--user disable --now`. If absent, behave like `up` and suggest `install-service` or `run`. Renamed from `stop`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `agentconnect restart`              | Run `down`, tolerating an already-stopped service, then `up`; both use the system service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `agentconnect status`               | Print service state (installed / running / PID / log path) and runtime state (CP connection, platform connections, active agents/sessions, degradation flag). Works even when no service is installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `agentconnect install-service`      | Generate/install a launchd plist or systemd unit and run `daemon-reload`; **do not start automatically**. Print the `agentconnect up` hint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `agentconnect uninstall-service`    | Run `down`, then remove the unit file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `agentconnect agent list`           | **Read-only:** list user-authored agents found under `--agents-dir`, including id, status, runtime, name, and directory. CP agents are memory-only and therefore are not part of this local-file listing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `agentconnect login`                | **Interactive CP onboarding:** prompt/read CP URL + token, then probe auth through `probeAuth`, which sends only `auth`, never `register`. On failure, show the reason and allow one token retry; a second failure exits 1. **Persist credentials only after success.** Ask whether to install as a background service: yes -> `install-service` + `up` and exit; no -> foreground `run` until Ctrl-C. Non-TTY falls back to flags, still probes/persists and skips prompts; there is no separate `--no-input`. |
| `agentconnect chat [message]`       | **Connect locally to one agent:** recursively discover agents under `--agents-dir`; use the only agent automatically, or require `--agent <name>` when several exist. Resolve its runtime, including registry defaults, launch the local ACP adapter, and converse over ACP. With `message`, send once, stream the reply, and exit; without it, enter a REPL. Do **not** start Slack, scheduler, store, CP, or the rest of daemon.                                                                              |

### 2.3 CLI Flags Override Configuration

**Precedence, high to low: `CLI flag > environment variable > config.json > built-in default`.** CLI flags override only **process-level** configuration such as endpoints, roots, and log level; they do not mutate agent business configuration.

| Flag                             | Config field overridden        | Purpose                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--config <path>`                | Locates the file itself        | Specify config.json, default `~/.agentconnect/config.json`.                                                                                        |
| `--root <dir>`                   | Locates the root               | Override `~/.agentconnect`; maps to `AGENTCONNECT_ROOT`.                                                                                           |
| `--api-url <wss://...>`          | `controlPlane.url`             | Override the API endpoint; this is the most common override.                                                                                       |
| `--api-key <key>`                | `controlPlane.key`             | Override the opaque, long-lived, revocable daemon **API key**; see [daemon-api-key-auth.md](daemon-api-key-auth.md).                               |
| `--no-cp` / `--offline`          | `controlPlane.enabled=false`   | Force local-only mode with no CP connection.                                                                                                       |
| `--daemon-id <id>`               | `daemonId`                     | Override/specify daemon identity.                                                                                                                  |
| `--log-level <lvl>`              | `logging.level`                | trace/debug/info/warn/error.                                                                                                                       |
| `--agents-dir <dir>`             | `agentsDir`                    | Override agent discovery root. Daemon/`chat` recursively collect `agent.json`, skipping `node_modules`, `.git`, dot directories, depth about four. |
| `--agent <name>`                 | Selector                       | Select by `agent.id`: single-agent `run` ignoring status, or disambiguate `chat`.                                                                  |
| `--max-agents <n>`               | `limits.maxAgents`             | Capacity reported to CP + local hard limit.                                                                                                        |
| `--require-sandbox`              | `security.requireSandbox=true` | Require every agent to run in the Linux SRT sandbox; refuse daemon startup on unsupported or failed hosts.                                         |
| n/a (config only)                | `sandbox.backend`              | Select the local sandbox backend; defaults to `srt`; `microsandbox` selects Linux VMs with an explicit image.                                      |
| n/a (config only)                | `sandbox.mounts`               | Host mappings: `readonly` (default), `writable`, or microsandbox-only `overlay`. SRT requires equal source/target paths.                           |
| `--k8s`                          | n/a (mode switch)              | Run runtimes in cluster sandbox pods instead of on this host; see section 2.6 for what that changes.                                               |
| `--key-server <url>`             | `KEY_SERVER`                   | Cloud-only service for session-scoped model credentials, http or https as the deployment chooses; see [key-server.md](key-server.md).              |
| `--key-server-token-path <path>` | `KEY_SERVER_TOKEN_PATH`        | File re-read as the key-server bearer token on every request.                                                                                      |
| `--key-server-ttl <seconds>`     | `KEY_SERVER_TTL_SECONDS`       | Credential lifetime to request; the issuer caps it. Defaults to effectively permanent — see [key-server.md](key-server.md) §3 for why.             |
| `--dry-run`                      | n/a                            | Load and validate all configuration and print the reconcile plan without opening connections/processes.                                            |

General environment equivalents use the `AGENTCONNECT_` prefix, such as `AGENTCONNECT_CP_URL`, `AGENTCONNECT_CP_KEY`, and `AGENTCONNECT_ROOT`. The cloud model seam uses `MODEL_TOKEN`, `MODEL_BASE_URL`, their runtime-scoped replacements (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL_*`, `OPENAI_MODEL_*`, `DEEPSEEK_MODEL_*`), `KEY_SERVER`, `KEY_SERVER_TOKEN_PATH`, and `KEY_SERVER_TTL_SECONDS` as documented above.

### 2.4 Mapping In-Process Responsibilities to CLI

`run`, including the same `run` managed by a service after `up`, starts every module in the section 1.2 diagram corresponding to upstream D1-D12: Supervisor, CP-Client, ConnectionManager and Platform Adapters, Local Router, Scheduler, ACP Host, MCP Tool Server, Workspace Manager, Local Store, and Telemetry. Secrets Agent remains future work. Sections 6-10 expand the parts directly related to the eight requirements.

### 2.5 Persistent System Service (Managed by the OS)

One **`ServiceController`** abstracts lifecycle, dispatching macOS to launchd, Linux to systemd `--user`, and `win32` to an error. It supplies the shared primitives behind `up`, `down`, `restart`, `status`, `install-service`, and `uninstall-service`:

```
install(opts)   Write the unit file (+ daemon-reload); do not start.
uninstall()     Run down(), then delete the unit.
up()            Load/enable + start.
down()          Stop + unload/disable.
status()        { installed, running, pid?, label, logPath }
isInstalled()   Whether the unit file exists.
```

- **macOS (launchd):** `~/Library/LaunchAgents/md.agentconnect.daemon.plist`, label `md.agentconnect.daemon` (a named instance adds `.<name>` to both — cli-daemon-split.md §4.2.1), reference `packages/cli/src/service/launchd.ts`. `ProgramArguments = [execPath, cliEntry, "run", "--root", root]`; `RunAtLoad=true`; `KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit=false`; `StandardOutPath` / `StandardErrorPath` point to `~/.agentconnect/logs/daemon.log`. `up` uses `launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID <plist>` with `load -w` fallback; `down` uses `launchctl bootout gui/$UID/<label>` with `unload -w` fallback; status uses `launchctl print` / `list`.
- **Linux (systemd, system scope):** `/etc/systemd/system/agentconnect.service` (a named instance is `agentconnect@<name>.service`), with `[Service] ExecStart=execPath cliEntry run --root <root>`, `User=<the daemon account>`, `WorkingDirectory=` + `Environment="HOME="` for that account, `Restart=always`, `Environment="AGENTCONNECT_ROOT=<root>"`, and `[Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target` — a `--user` unit dies with the last login session when `Linger=no`. Run `systemctl daemon-reload` after writing. Install also `enable`s the unit and writes `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/49-<unit>.rules` scoped to that unit and account, so `up = start` and `down = stop` need no privilege; only `install-service` / `uninstall-service` re-exec through sudo. Status uses `is-active` and `show -p MainPID`. Legacy `~/.config/systemd/user` units remain drivable in their own scope and are retired (unelevated) by the next `install-service`. See cli-daemon-split.md §4.2.2.
- **Service environment (login-shell launch):** service managers give user units a minimal `PATH` and never source shell profiles, so without repair npx-distributed ACP runtimes probe as "not installed". The unit therefore runs the **CLI run shell** (`ExecStart=<node> <cli-entry> run`), which in service mode launches the daemon through the user's interactive login shell (`$SHELL -l -i -c 'exec "$0" "$@"' …`, `packages/cli/src/service-spawn.ts` + `shell-exec.ts`) — the daemon inherits a fresh terminal-equivalent environment and tracks profile edits at every restart. Readiness is verified via `<root>/daemon.lock` (pid preserved by `exec`); a hanging or broken profile is killed at a deadline and the run shell falls back to direct spawns. Two static floors back this up: an install-time `PATH` snapshot baked into the unit (`InstallOpts.envPath`) and the daemon prepending `dirname(process.execPath)` on startup (`packages/daemon/src/runtimes/exec-path.ts`, covers legacy direct-ExecStart units). See cli-daemon-split.md §4.2 for the full contract.
- **Testability:** Pure builders `buildPlist` / `buildSystemdUnit` generate unit contents for direct assertions. Every `launchctl` / `systemctl` call uses an injectable `exec(cmd,args)` dependency, replaced by test stubs with no real side effects.
- **Multiple instances:** One host can run several daemon services side by side. `--instance <name>` names the unit and defaults the root to `~/.agentconnect-<name>`; `<root>/service.json` maps a root back to its unit so `--root`-only commands (the CP-commanded upgrade) hit the right one; `agentconnect instances` lists them. The default instance's unit names are unchanged. See cli-daemon-split.md §4.2.1.
- **Credentials:** Unit files include only nonsensitive `AGENTCONNECT_ROOT`, and only when nondefault. The opaque CP API key lives in `config.json`; hand-authored local integrations may carry platform tokens in `agent.json`, while CP-delivered tokens remain memory-only. None belongs in the plist/unit. The key has no prefix and cannot be redacted by a content pattern; logs, telemetry, and error frames must structurally redact values of `--api-key`, `apiKey`, and `Bearer ...` before leaving the edge.
- The `run` process handles `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT`: stop accepting new messages, drain active turns to a deadline, close platform connections, close ACP adapter children, then exit.

> The service-install branch of `login` invokes this controller. After successful auth probing and persistence, yes -> `install()` + `up()` and exit; no -> start foreground `run` using the same Daemon construction and signal handling.

### 2.6 Cluster Mode (`--k8s`)

`run --k8s` is the same binary and the same Daemon, supervising runtimes in cluster sandbox pods rather than as local subprocesses. It is a mode switch rather than a separate build, and it exists so that every behavior assuming "daemon and runtime share one machine" is disabled — or given a pod-shaped implementation — in one place instead of being re-decided per call site.

| Behavior under `--k8s`                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| No HOST runtime probe sweep and no probe refresh; the sweep runs in the probe sandbox instead, and no phase-2 model enumeration runs at all                                                                                              | There is no runtime binary next to the daemon — runtimes ship in the sandbox image, so a host sweep can only ever answer "nothing". The models a runtime offers still have to be ASKED of it, which is why the probe sandbox runs one credentialed session per declared runtime (below). Phase-2 enumeration needs a per-model isolated HOME on this host and has none, so a cluster runtime stops at the phase-1 seed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| A declared curated-source runtime is admitted only when the image installed it as its own executable AND published its build-time `initialize` snapshot, and is then sourced `image`; every other curated declaration is dropped, loudly | Curated admission is a successful ACP probe, and `--k8s` runs none — but the image's own build-time probe is that evidence, taken in the very image the runtime will run in. Re-sourcing is what carries it: an entry left `curated` would sit forever pending the host probe this mode never makes. A declaration with no snapshot behind it is still just a claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| The console's Git panel resolves its root in the POD's coordinates, like the ACP cwd; its last-fetch time is withheld, and an unchanged path's existence is asked of git rather than of a filesystem                                     | Same rule as the credential pointers: the environment must not describe one filesystem while the git that reads it runs in another. Resolving `agent.workspace.path` here handed a ShimGitRunner a daemon path, the shim's cwd fence refused it, and the panel reported "not a git checkout" over a real checkout. `.git/FETCH_HEAD`'s mtime is the only record of a fetch and no subcommand reports it, so that one field answers "unknown" until the shim can stat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Every console workspace read needs a BOUND sandbox; with no channel both seams refuse with `sandbox-unavailable` rather than waking the pod                                                                                              | The console re-reads on each session page view, so waking on a read would resurrect a suspended pod on every visit and fight the idle sweep. What it must not do is answer as if it knew: falling through to this daemon's filesystem reports "not a git checkout" and an empty file tree for a workspace that is intact and comes back on the agent's next turn. It is the one workspace reason that is TRANSIENT, so the CP answers 503 **with** the code — a 400 would tell the console to stop retrying, and a bare 503 is indistinguishable from a daemon that may never return. The reachability answer and the resolution are ONE step, not a check followed by a use: the shim re-dials at half its credential TTL, so a fence that probes and then resolves can be handed this daemon's filesystem by the second call — which is how a read reports an empty workspace and a create publishes onto the daemon disk. Sandbox mode therefore has no local fallback at all. The console closes the loop with an explicit press rather than better prose: `POST /agents/:id/wake` resolves the dispatch member, claims the duty if that member does not hold it, and brings the sandbox to Running plus a shim bind — no host, no ACP session — after which the same read succeeds. A GET still wakes nothing. |
| The console's Files panel and local-skills list are served by the `read` channel, which runs the SAME workspace file operations inside the pod                                                                                           | They answer with file bytes, so unlike git there is nothing to orchestrate — the daemon names one operation and the shim performs it on the mounted volume. It does NOT run the daemon's implementation: on a volume the agent's runtime writes to, checking a path and then acting on it is a window that no amount of re-checking closes, so the pod side resolves one path (the mount, which cannot be renamed) and takes every step below it from an open descriptor. Linux-only, and a symlinked directory inside the workspace is refused rather than resolved — the single behavioural divergence, recorded in [cluster-spawn-and-shim.md](cluster-spawn-and-shim.md) §5 along with what the two halves still share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The declared table lives in the runtime image and is obtained by ASKING a sandbox which runtimes it provides (the shim's `probe` channel), because a list compiled into the daemon or copied into a ConfigMap can be wrong about the image with nothing noticing and lists the runtime ids the image provides, optionally with the image's version pin and a model snapshot. Commands and arguments still come from the resolved catalog, which is served cache-first and can therefore be satisfied by an `acp_registry.json` baked into the image. A declared model snapshot is reported with `modelsSource: 'cached'`: no live probe confirmed it, so model capability gates stay permissive.

**One member per runtime image runs that probe for the whole pool** ([k8s-daemon-pool.md](k8s-daemon-pool.md) §3): members elect through a claim in the shared store keyed on the image the SandboxTemplate pins, and the winner publishes its whole answer for the others to adopt. Nothing is lost by sharing it — the answer is about the image, and a second member asking the same image the same question can only get the same answer at the cost of another pod. Nothing is risked either, because the key IS the image: a template bump is a different row, so a member never adopts a previous image's runtimes, and a rollout is simply two questions. A member that cannot read the image, cannot reach the store, or cannot parse what it finds probes for itself.

**The models come from a second, credentialed pass over the SAME held sandbox** (`runtimes/cluster-probe.ts`): each declared runtime is launched in the pod through the cluster driver, given one throwaway session, and asked what its model selector advertises — reported `probed`, exactly like a host sweep. The table alone cannot answer this and must not pretend to: it is generated at image build time, in an image that deliberately carries no provider credentials, so it publishes no model list and every cluster runtime reached the console with an empty picker. Credentials are the whole difference, and they exist in the two places this launch already reaches — the deployment's own pair on the daemon (`*_MODEL_TOKEN` / `*_MODEL_BASE_URL`, written onto each runtime's own provider surface exactly as a real launch writes it) and the pod's `AC_*` fill-in on the SandboxTemplate. A deployment whose egress mints its keys per session configures an endpoint with no key, and codex and DeepSeek Harness refuse `session/new` outright without one — so the probe launches those with a stand-in key (`PROBE_PLACEHOLDER_KEY`) it never spends: the enumeration reads the model selector and never prompts, and losing the whole picker to a credential nothing needs is the worse answer. A runtime that answers `authRequired` is recorded as installed-but-logged-out rather than failing the sweep, unless the probe carried no credential at all for a runtime that takes one (`uncredentialed`), which is the deployment's gap and keeps the declared facts — publishing it would empty the picker and ask the user to log a pod in; a runtime the probe could not REACH keeps the image's declared facts, because an empty `probed` list is a strict model gate and one slow pod must not refuse an agent the table already vouches for; and a sweep that fails at all costs model detail, never the runtime list.

`--k8s` selects an implementation; it must not change product semantics. A `k8s` branch inside business logic — rather than in the driver, reporting, or startup-assembly layers — means a seam is missing. The credential and workspace paths are the worked example: they are resolvers (`runsInSandbox`, the git runner, the credential target) rather than conditionals at each call site.

#### Kubernetes as the supervisor

`AGENTCONNECT_SUPERVISOR=k8s` declares that the kubelet stands in for launchd/systemd **and** for the CLI's version store. Kubernetes supervises those two roles asymmetrically, so the lifecycle contract distinguishes them rather than gating both on "is a supervisor present":

- **`daemon/restart` is supported.** The daemon drains and exits with the reserved restart code, and `restartPolicy: Always` brings the container back in place, in the same pod — the same shape as a systemd process restart. Re-register plus an incremented epoch remains the control plane's completion signal. Note the kubelet applies an exponential restart backoff (capped in the minutes), so repeated restarts complete more slowly than under systemd; a control-plane timeout should be calibrated against that rather than against a local restart.
- **`daemon/upgrade` is refused on the mode**, not on the supervisor marker. A live upgrade command is delivered to every ready daemon without consulting the advertised `daemon-bootstrap-upgrade-v1` capability, so admission is the last line of defence — and cluster mode must hold the same invariant as the capability check: an inherited `AGENTCONNECT_SUPERVISOR=service` plus a stale but valid `cli-entry` on the root volume cannot reach the installer. The reason says the running version is the pod's image, because "no supervisor" would send an operator looking in the wrong place when a `cli-entry` does exist. Upgrading means rolling the Deployment.
- **A declared supervisor is still required.** `--k8s` alone does not admit a restart: exiting with nothing to bring the process back leaves the daemon down, so the launcher has to declare `k8s`.

Draining is the existing SIGTERM path — gate new turns, await in-flight ones, cancel stragglers — which is what a `preStop` hook and a SIGTERM both reach. The turn wait is classed by whether the work can move to a successor: under `--k8s`, and for a **set-placed** agent's turn on any duty-holding member, it runs to `limits.poolShutdownDrainMs` (the member also releases each held group with an acknowledged `duty/release`; k8s-daemon-pool.md §12); a **daemon-placed** agent's turn — work no successor can take, stamped `placement` on the duty grant's member — is cut at `limits.shutdownDrainMs`, so an in-place restart of a machine full of pinned agents never pays the pod-eviction wait. **`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` must exceed that budget**, or the kubelet SIGKILLs mid-drain and the graceful window is a promise the deployment cannot keep. The daemon cannot read its own grace period (it has no pod read access), so at startup in cluster mode it logs the drain deadline it will actually use and leaves the alignment to the deployment.

**Readiness is a published fact, not a timer.** A `--k8s` daemon's process is ready long before it can serve anything: it still has to register with the control plane and learn from a sandbox what the runtime image provides. So it publishes one predicate — startup complete **and** CP registration acknowledged **and** the runtime probe returned **and** not draining — on the two sinks a pod probe can read, `GET /readyz` on `AC_READINESS_PORT` and a marker file at `AC_READINESS_FILE`. The two sinks default differently on purpose: the HTTP endpoint is opt-in (`AC_READINESS_PORT`, off until a port is named, and it must never be routed by a Service — it is a probe surface only), while the marker file is on by default at `/var/run/agentconnect/ready` and is turned off only by setting `AC_READINESS_FILE` empty, so a pod that mounts a writable path gets an `exec` probe with no configuration at all. Neither exists outside cluster mode, where the process being up is the signal. The predicate goes false synchronously with the SIGTERM latch, which is what stops new traffic while the pod keeps running for the whole drain; and clearing a stale marker is the first statement of `start()`, because a file on a mounted path outlives the container that wrote it. `packages/daemon/src/readiness.ts`; [k8s-daemon-pool.md](k8s-daemon-pool.md) §12 for what the rollout does with it.

Single-instance safety differs by shape. A daemon that owns its state — one machine, one SQLite store — keeps the singleton lock plus a `ReadWriteOncePod` volume and `strategy: Recreate`, so no two processes overlap on it. A pool member owns none: its state root is an `emptyDir`, its durable store is the shared data plane, and its exactly-one responsibilities are duty leases rather than a volume — which is what lets the pool roll with `maxSurge: 100%` and `maxUnavailable: 0` instead of replacing in place.

## 3. Configuration File: `~/.agentconnect/config.json`

### 3.1 Core Principle: Local Files and CP Memory Are Separate Desired-State Sources

This chapter, section 4 agents, and section 5 Reconciler form one theme:

- Hand-authored `~/.agentconnect/config.json` and `agents/**/agent.json` files are the local desired-state source and remain user-owned.
- CP agent specs, integrations, and crons are a separate **memory-only** desired-state source, re-converged by `register/ok` after each connection. Receiving a CP agent deletes only a same-id `agent.json`; every other local file remains untouched.
- An already-running daemon continues using its in-memory CP state while disconnected. After a daemon restart, CP-managed agents resume only after the CP roster reconnects; local agents remain independently bootable from disk.

The daemon persists only a secret-free `.cp-agent-id` marker in a dedicated child data root for CP agents, so workspace and memory directories can be reused without persisting CP configuration or credentials. Marker-only roots discovered after restart are reported as CP-owned replicas but are not activated; this lets the next roster reconciliation remove stale roots without reviving an agent whose in-memory spec was lost.

### 3.2 Root Layout

```
~/.agentconnect/
|- config.json                 # Machine/daemon configuration; this section.
|- acp_registry.json           # Raw ACP registry response cache; section 3.3.1.
|- acp_registry.cache.json     # Registry validators {etag,lastModified,fetchedAt}.
|- agents/                     # Per-agent configuration + default workspace; section 4.
|  `- <agent-id>/
|     |- agent.json
|     `- workspace/
|- state/
|  `- local.sqlite            # Sessions/routes/cron last-run/telemetry buffer.
`- logs/
   `- daemon.log
```

The layout keeps machine configuration, per-agent desired state, durable runtime state, and logs separate. The organizational unit is the **agent**, so each agent receives its own directory, while process lifecycle belongs to the OS service manager rather than application-managed PID or running-marker files.

On POSIX hosts, AgentConnect removes group/other access from existing
`config.json` and `agent.json` files; newly created or rewritten files use mode
`0600`. Agent directories created by the daemon use `0700`; existing custom
agent directories and higher custom parents are left unchanged.

### Linux ACP runtime sandbox

`sandbox.backend` defaults to `srt`; Linux hosts with KVM can select `microsandbox`.
Operator-owned filesystem access is configured through `sandbox.mounts`.
The [sandbox backend design](daemon-sandbox-backends.md) documents configuration,
the implemented VM backend, and its remaining image/networking extensions. The behavior below
describes the current SRT implementation.

AgentConnect currently enables runtime sandboxing on Linux only. The daemon uses
the exact-pinned `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` package, backed by `bubblewrap`,
and launches a separate SRT provider process for each ordinary ACP host so policy
state is never shared between agents. The host must provide working `bwrap`,
`socat`, and `rg` executables and permit unprivileged user namespaces. Startup
performs a live probe rather than treating installed binaries as sufficient, and
logs its verdict: `sandbox: bwrap ready`, or a warning carrying the provider's
own failure text and the daemon's `PATH`. A failed probe is not confined to
agent launches — managed skill installation runs the pinned skills CLI inside
the same kernel sandbox and has no fail-open path, so it fails on every
reconcile until the missing dependencies are installed.

An enabled sandbox gives the runtime a private HOME, hides daemon-owned agent
metadata and the host source from which that runtime state was seeded, and
re-allows reads only for the workspace, private HOME, managed memory,
`run/config-files`, `.agentconnect/runtime-policy`, trusted runtime installation
roots, any operator-declared `sandbox.mounts` (host toolchains such as
nvm's node or a rustup toolchain, made readable in every sandbox regardless
of runtime), and the runtime's selected host credential path. Writes are limited to
the workspace, private HOME, managed memory, SRT temporary storage, that
credential path, and mounts with `mode: "writable"` (such as a shared
package-manager store). Outbound domains are approved by a provider callback and Unix sockets remain
compatibility-open during this rollout. Proxy-aware HTTP(S) clients retain web
egress, and the provider sets `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` so Node's built-in `fetch`
and `http` clients (corepack downloading a pinned package manager, for one) join
them. SRT's isolated Linux network namespace still means host access to an
agent-started local server and other clients that ignore the proxy environment
are not yet compatibility guarantees; issue #312 tracks those boundaries. SRT's
temporary directory is redirected below the private HOME and its shared
`/tmp/claude` fallback is hidden.

Mounts default to read-only. SRT expands host `~` and normalizes both paths;
`source` and `target` must resolve to the same existing host path. Remapping a
host path to a different target is rejected. Writable mounts also extend the
runtime-native tool sandbox's write permissions, so the actual package-manager
process can use them. Configure the package manager to use the target path;
mounts do not change its settings. These paths are shared across sessions,
and their host contents survive session cleanup. Replace the removed
`security.sandboxReadRoots` and `security.sandboxWriteRoots` fields manually as
shown in [the conversion table](daemon-sandbox-backends.md#shared-mounts-and-manual-conversion).

The Claude ACP parent is trusted to manage the host Claude login. By default,
AgentConnect resolves the host config directory from `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, falling
back to `$HOME/.claude`, and passes that directory to the private-HOME runtime as
`CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR`. This preserves the host CLI's default
`.credentials.json` in place and permits Claude's temporary-file-plus-rename
refresh behavior. AgentConnect does not rewrite host Claude settings or relocate
the host credential between secure-storage directories. Claude's nested sandbox
denies this parent-only path to model-authored Bash and its descendants.

Operators who do not want the trusted ACP parent to see the rest of the host
Claude config directory can create a dedicated absolute directory and set
`CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR` in the host Claude `settings.json` environment,
then run host `claude /login`. AgentConnect follows that setting and re-opens only
the selected directory. A daemon process environment value takes precedence over
the settings value; to keep host `/login` on the same path, set the value in the
environment used by both processes or prefer Claude settings. If neither is set,
the Claude config directory is the intentional trusted default. Installations
whose settings already select an `agentconnect-auth` directory continue using it.

Read access outside the explicitly denied agent/runtime-state roots remains
unchanged in this rollout. This is not yet a whole-host read allowlist: unrelated
host files and another runtime's credential source require a separate policy.

When sandboxing is only an agent preference and the live probe fails, the daemon
logs a warning and runs that agent without confinement. With
`security.requireSandbox=true` or `--require-sandbox`, the same failure refuses
daemon startup. macOS and Windows always follow this unsupported-host behavior;
this rollout intentionally adds no runtime-specific Keychain integration.

A curated or operator runtime may declare `externalExecution` on its RuntimeDef:
its launched process is a thin bridge to a machine-local service that actually
executes the agent (OpenClaw's `openclaw acp` and its Gateway), so kernel
confinement of the bridge contains nothing while SRT's isolated network
namespace severs the loopback dial the bridge exists for. Such a runtime
launches exactly like any unsandboxed runtime — inherited daemon environment,
real host HOME — while its curated admission probe still runs in a disposable
isolated HOME. An agent's optional sandbox request is downgraded with a
warning, and `security.requireSandbox` keeps the launch and its admission probe
failing loudly, so the runtime is not advertised on hosts that demand
confinement. Agent configuration cannot set the flag; it lives on the
daemon/registry-owned runtime definition alongside `readRoots`.

`security.workspaceGitAllowedOrigins` is a daemon-local remote-origin policy. Tenant
workspace configuration cannot widen it, and the control plane intentionally
keeps only transport/credential validation because different daemons may permit
different self-managed Git services. A manual GitLab or self-managed workspace
therefore requires the daemon operator to add its exact HTTPS or SSH origin and
restart the daemon. A configured array replaces the defaults, so deployments
that still use GitHub or GitHub App workspaces must keep the corresponding
GitHub origins in the array.

Daemon-managed workspace clone/pull does not inherit proxy variables, system or
user Git routing config, or user SSH config. It refuses HTTPS redirects and
secondary bundle/packfile URI downloads, disables automatic submodule and Git
LFS fetching, and rejects checkout-local URL rewrites, includes, and proxy
overrides before pull. Operators should use an explicit repository URL
(including an SSH port when needed) instead of redirects, proxies, or SSH host
aliases. This policy covers daemon-managed workspace materialization only;
agent-initiated Git commands and configured skill-source installation have
separate trust boundaries.

#### 3.3.1 Default Runtimes Come from the ACP Registry

`config.json.runtimes` is **optional**. At daemon/`chat` startup, `resolveRuntimes` merges registry defaults with configuration overrides by name, with config taking priority. An `agent.json` containing only `"runtime": "claude-acp"` therefore works without runtime setup.

- **Source:** `https://cdn.agentclientprotocol.com/registry/v1/latest/registry.json`, shaped `{version, agents}`, where each agent includes `id / name / version / distribution`.
- **Fetch/cache:** Fetch at runtime and persist raw response to `~/.agentconnect/acp_registry.json` plus validators `{etag,lastModified,fetchedAt}` to `~/.agentconnect/acp_registry.cache.json`. Use conditional `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since`. On 304, network failure, or about 4.5-second timeout, use cache. Offline with no cache yields an empty registry.
- **Startup:** **Cache first + background refresh.** Existing cache applies synchronously; background refresh affects the next start, so network never blocks daemon startup.
- **Version pinning:** Keep `@version` from the registry snapshot, such as `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.51.0`, for reproducibility. Refresh updates the version.
- **Map `distribution` to `RuntimeDef {command,args,env}`** for the current `process.platform` + architecture:
  - `npx` -> `npx -y <package@version> [...args]`; `-y` avoids interactive install independently of the pin.
  - `uvx` -> `uvx <package==version> [...args]`.
  - `binary` -> use `cmd` / `args` / `env` under the current key such as `darwin-aarch64`, `linux-x86_64`, or `windows-x86_64`; skip when absent.
- **Limitation:** Binary distributions map only `cmd`, such as `./goose`; they do **not** download `archive`. The user must install it or put it on PATH. Spawn `ENOENT` should produce a friendly message. `RuntimeDef` does not retain archive URLs.

### 3.4 Field Precedence and Merge

Apply, later overriding earlier: built-in defaults including **ACP-registry runtime defaults** -> `config.json` -> `AGENTCONNECT_*` environment -> CLI flags. `controlPlane.url` is overridden most often through `--api-url` because one image connects to different CP environments.

### 3.5 Validation and Live Reload

- Validate with Zod schemas from `protocol`. Invalid configuration makes `run` refuse startup with field-level errors. CP delivery or manual editing owns `config.json`; daemon offers no mutation CLI.
- Changes to `config.json` trigger Reconciler evaluation of connections, runtimes, and limits. Changes to **`controlPlane.url` / `daemonId` require restart**, because they affect identity and connection ownership.

## 4. `~/.agentconnect/agents/`: Agent Configuration and Default Workspace

### 4.1 Directory Layout (One Subdirectory per Agent)

```
~/.agentconnect/agents/
`- deploy-bot/                 # Conventionally agent-id; authoritative ID is agent.json.id.
   |- agent.json               # Complete declaration; section 4.2.
   |- workspace/               # Default workspace; from-scratch uses this directly.
   |  |- memory.md             # Persisted memory in from-scratch mode.
   |  `- .skills/              # Installed skills.
   `- sessions/                # Optional local snapshots; authoritative state is state/local.sqlite.
```

- `agent.json.id` is globally unique, referenced by CP orchestration and `route/*`, and selected by `--agent <name>`.
- **Discovery is recursive:** daemon/`chat` bounded-recursively collect any `agent.json` under `--agents-dir`, skipping `node_modules`, `.git`, dot directories, to depth about four. Pointing `--agents-dir` directly at one agent finds depth-zero `agent.json`. `loadAgents` selects `status==="active"`; `--agent` / `chat` selection ignores status.
- **Workspace resolution:** Relative `agent.json.workspace.path` is relative to the agent directory. In `git-repo` mode, daemon clones/pulls there.

### 4.2 `agent.json` Schema

This aligns upstream section 6.6 `Agent` / `Integration` / `Workspace` / `CronJob` with the daemon's current `AgentSchema`, `IntegrationSchema`, and `SlackConfigSchema` in `packages/daemon/src/agents/agent-schema.ts`.

```jsonc

}
```

### 4.3 Workspace Preparation (`cwd` for ACP `session/new`)

Before a new or reloaded session, Session Manager calls `prepareWorkspace(agent)`:

1. `git-repo`: validate `agentDir`; clone the configured repository and branch if no checkout exists, or run a best-effort `git pull --ff-only` with an approximately 4.5-second timeout when `pullOnNewSession` is enabled. A clone failure is fatal because no checkout exists; a pull failure is nonfatal so offline execution can continue from disk.
2. `from-scratch`: ensure the workspace directory exists; agent memory is initialized separately under the agent root by `packages/daemon/src/memory/store.ts`.
3. Return the absolute repository root, validated `agentDir`, or from-scratch directory as the `cwd` for section 7 `session/new` or `session/load`.

Workspace preparation is implemented by `packages/daemon/src/workspace/workspace-manager.ts` and invoked from `packages/daemon/src/session/session-manager.ts`.

### 4.4 Agent Environment / Secrets: CP Configuration + Child-Process Injection

Ordinary environment variables and write-only secrets can be configured through Console / CP `AgentSpec.env` and `AgentSpec.secrets`. The daemon keeps CP values in memory and `agentChildEnv()` merges/injects them when starting an ACP child; it never writes those values to `agent.json`.

- Secret wins over ordinary env with the same name; daemon security/runtime injection remains higher priority.
- Sandboxed launches also inherit daemon-local [`sandbox.env`](daemon-sandbox-backends.md#sandbox-environment-defaults) defaults, below runtime-definition and agent env/secrets.
- Env/secrets changes affect host spawn. Reconcile evicts the old host so the next start uses the new values.
- Daemon **does not read** a sibling `.env` and does not interpolate `${VAR}` in `agent.json`; configuration, descriptions, and cron-trigger strings remain literal.
- Secret values are never logged. The model receives only secret names and confidentiality constraints; values exist only in child environment, with unified secret masking as a leak backstop.

---

## 5. CP Control + Offline Degradation: Reconciler

This implements requirement 4 using section 3.1 configuration-as-desired-state.

### 5.1 CP Configuration Is Applied in Memory

CP agent, integration, and cron frames are applied to memory-only registries by CP-Client. Other control-plane state retains the persistence policy listed below:

| CP delivery                                      | Daemon persistence action                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent/upsert{ agentId, spec }` / `agent/remove` | Upsert/remove the in-memory CP agent; delete only a same-id local `agent.json`.              |
| `integration/upsert` / `integration/remove`      | Upsert/remove the in-memory CP integration overlay.                                          |
| `register/ok` roster snapshot                    | Fully **converge** memory-only agents/integrations/crons; explicit `drop.*` removes entries. |
| `agent/stop{ agentId }`                          | Set `status:"inactive"` while keeping directory.                                             |
| `route/assign` / `route/update`                  | Update local route table persisted in `state/local.sqlite`.                                  |
| `cron/upsert` / `cron/remove`                    | Upsert/remove the in-memory CP cron overlay.                                                 |
| `config/push{ keys }` EVT                        | Apply allowlisted runtime knobs **in memory**, without persistence; see note below.          |

REQ commands such as `agent/upsert`, `agent/stop`, `cron/upsert`, `cron/remove`, and `route/assign` receive `ack{ refId, ok }` after application/convergence.

`config/push` has only `{ keys }` as an EVT with **no reply**. It merges
allowlisted nonsensitive keys (`logging.level`, `limits.maxAgents`,
`limits.maxConcurrentSessions`, and `limits.agentIdleTimeoutMs`; see
`mergeConfigPush`) into the live in-memory configuration and applies them
immediately, rebuilding the logger for level changes. It does not persist or
ACK; nonallowlisted keys are ignored and logged. Desired agent and integration
state is delivered through the dedicated upsert frames and the authoritative
`register/ok` roster.

### 5.2 Reconciler: Desired State -> Actual State

Changes from **CP**, an **agentconnect agent command**, or **manual file edits** all use one reconciler, driven by `chokidar` on `agents/**` plus explicit triggers:

```
desired = merge(local active agent.json files, CP agents/integrations/crons in memory)
actual  = live platform connections / ACP adapters / registered crons
plan    = diff(desired, actual)
apply(plan):
  - New/changed integration -> ConnectionManager opens/updates connection
  - active -> inactive       -> drain sessions and reclaim ACP adapter child
  - runtime/workspace change -> applies to next new session; do not interrupt active
  - cron change              -> Scheduler upsert/remove
```

Convergence is **idempotent**: restart from disk desired state yields the same runtime state.

### 5.3 State Alignment While CP Is Online

After connecting, CP-Client sends `register` with capabilities and `localState` for current agents/integrations/crons/assignments. CP returns an **authoritative roster snapshot** in `register/ok`; daemon fully converges it to disk, then Reconciler converges runtime. Later deltas use `agent/upsert`, `integration/upsert`, `route/update`, and related frames. **CP is the editor, not a runtime dependency.**

### 5.4 Offline / Degraded Semantics

| Scenario                                 | Behavior                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CP temporarily unreachable               | CP-Client reconnects with exponential backoff. Platform connections, active sessions, and crons continue from last disk desired state. |
| New agent placement / scaling            | **Paused**, because CP orchestration is required; catches up after reconnect.                                                          |
| `--no-cp` / `controlPlane.enabled=false` | Pure local mode from disk, suitable for single-machine self-hosted / BYO.                                                              |
| Telemetry                                | Buffer in `state/local.sqlite` and upload after recovery.                                                                              |

## 6. Consolidating and Managing Multi-Agent Platform Connections

A daemon can host many agents, each with many integrations. **Do not open one independent connection per integration**; consolidate by credential.

### 6.1 Consolidation Key: `(platform, credential fingerprint)`

- **Slack `mode:"direct"` (default):** One **Socket Mode connection = one Slack App = one `appToken` + `botToken` set**. `SlackConnection` in `packages/daemon/src/slack/connection.ts` creates `new App({ token, appToken, socketMode: true })`. The key is the `appToken` fingerprint.
- **Slack `mode:"shared"` (relay ingress):** Shared-bot ingress does not run in daemon. The **relay pool** receives Events API traffic, arbitrates, and pre-addresses delivery. Daemon holds only `xoxb` for egress and **opens no socket**. It dials each relay in the CP-distributed roster from `register/ok.relays` / `relay/roster`, persisted in `config.json.relays`, using `cp/relay-client.ts` / `relay-manager.ts`. See section 7.3 of [shared-bot-relay.md](shared-bot-relay.md).
- Usually one agent = one bot = one Slack App, but two agents sharing one App and `appToken` use **one connection**, with inbound events routed by channel binding.
- **Telegram:** One grammY long-polling `getUpdates` connection per bot token.
- **Discord:** One gateway connection per bot token.
- **Lark / Feishu:** One SDK client per app (`appId` + `appSecret`); direct mode opens
  `WSClient`, while HTTP mode keeps the client send-only and receives
  pre-addressed relay ingress. See [feishu-integration.md](feishu-integration.md).

### 6.2 Startup Consolidation

```
1. Scan integrations[] for every active agents/<id>/agent.json.
2. Read platform tokens, plaintext in the current version.
3. Group/deduplicate by (platform, credential fingerprint).
4. Open one ConnectionManager connection per group; retry failures and report alert.
5. Derive the local `RoutingRule[]` layer from every integration's `bindRules` through `rulesFromAgent()`.
```

One `RoutingRule` model drives routing. Every integration `bindRules[]` entry derives a `source:"config"` local rule with agentId, integrationId, platform, scope, and match. Merge these with `source:"cp"` rules and arbitrate through `routeRules()`. Cache the local layer in `state/local.sqlite` for degradation; CP-layer persistence is described in sections 8.7/6.3. `rulesFromAgent()` in `packages/daemon/src/router/routing-rule.ts` derives the local rules, and `routeRules()` in `packages/daemon/src/router/routing-table.ts` defines arbitration.

### 6.3 Inbound Event -> Agent Routing

After a Slack event reaches a connection:

1. Over the union of local and CP rules, calculate **scope candidates**, then **kind candidates** whose `mention` / `dm` / `keyword` / `auto` matches.
2. First-match arbitration: **explicit @bot mention** -> **thread affinity** (single reachable agent continues; multiple reachable agents require mention) -> **CP per-sessionKey override** -> **local layer**. Within a layer: `mention > dm > keyword > auto`.
3. On match, normalize to `NormalizedMessage` with `traceId` and send to section 7 ACP Host. On null, drop + debug-log; it may still enter thread transcript for later catch-up.

> **Conflicts:** If A has channel-specific `auto` and B has broad `mention`, each participates by its own rule and a mentioned message goes only to that agent. **Local is baseline and CP overrides by sessionKey, but explicit `@bot` wins across layers.** A CP agentId with no matching local agent/Slack integration is unserviceable: keep it for reconciliation, skip it in `route()`, warn, and include in `heartbeat.degradedScopes`.

### 6.4 Connection Lifecycle and Live Updates

- Integration add/delete/credential change makes Reconciler open a new connection, close the old, or reconnect without affecting others.
- A disconnected platform connection reconnects directly with exponential backoff, bypassing CP. Persistent failure reports an `event/session` alert.
- ConnectionManager dispatches by platform through `{open,close,send}` drivers. Slack, Telegram, Discord, and Lark / Feishu each have implemented connection/normalize/render modules under `src/{slack,telegram,discord,feishu}/`. A new platform adds a driver without changing routing/consolidation.

---

## 7. Agent and Child-Process Lifecycle: Message -> ACP -> Claude/Codex

### 7.1 Process Tree

```
agentconnect daemon (Node, one process)
 |- ConnectionManager          One connection per platform credential
 |- Local Router / Normalizer  In process
 |- ACP Host                   Local ACP client, in process
 |- MCP Tool Server            In-process stdio MCP server
 `- One per active agent:
      claude-agent-acp / codex-acp      Child, stdio JSON-RPC local ACP
       `- One per session:
            Claude Agent SDK Query      Long-lived child
             `- native claude binary / codex engine
```

One ACP adapter child can host multiple sessions through its internal `sessions` map. Each session starts one long-lived Query child reused across prompts; it is not one process per message.

An entitled webchat session — any agent's — may receive an additional
session-scoped remote HTTPS MCP descriptor. It uses the normal agent-scoped ACP
host; this feature does not require a dedicated adapter, private socket, or OS
sandbox. See section 7.6 and
[`webchat-preset-agentconnect-mcp.md`](webchat-preset-agentconnect-mcp.md).

### 7.2 Agent (ACP Adapter) State Machine

```
inactive --(reconcile status=active)--> provisioned
provisioned --(first message / warm-start)--> starting
   starting: spawn runtime child through execa -> ACP initialize capability handshake
starting --ok--> ready --(error/crash)--> restarting --> ready
ready --(idle > agentIdleTimeoutMs)--> draining --> provisioned
ready --(status=inactive / agent/stop)--> draining --> inactive
```

- **Lazy start + warm pool:** First message starts by default; CP can request warm-start for frequent agents. Reclaim idle adapters to save memory on multi-agent edge machines.
- **Crash recovery:** ACP Host detects adapter exit, restarts it, and attempts `session/load` for active sessions. Failure marks the session interrupted and notifies its channel.

### 7.3 Session State Machine (Thread = Session)

`thread = one task = one context`. Session key is `(platform, channel, thread, agentId)`, allowing one session per agent in a shared thread:

```
none --(first thread message)--> preparing (git pull / memory)
preparing --> creating (session/new: cwd + mcpServers)
creating --> idle
idle --(message/cron synthetic message)--> prompting (session/prompt)
prompting --(streaming session/update)--> idle (turn ends with stopReason)
idle --(cancel)--> cancelling (session/cancel, 30s forced backstop) --> idle
prompting --(no runtime signal > turnStallTimeoutMs)--> cancelling (stall watchdog: ⚠️ notice, session/cancel, same backstop) --> idle
idle --(long inactivity / TTL)--> closed (metadata retained; body in Local Store)
closed --(new thread message)--> resuming (session/load) --> idle
```

**Stall watchdog.** A `session/prompt` can stall at the network layer — a
live TCP connection to the model API with no bytes arriving — and nothing in
the runtime errors it. The SDK-lifecycle lease then protects the session from
the idle sweep precisely because a prompt is running, so without a watchdog
the turn hangs forever and every later message queues behind it. The idle
sweep therefore also checks each in-flight prompt's last runtime signal
(`session/update`, an SDK lifecycle message, or a human answering its card;
time spent waiting on a permission or elicitation card does not count). Past
`limits.turnStallTimeoutMs` the daemon logs a warning, posts the same
`⚠️ Agent failed to respond` notice a failed turn gets, and cancels the turn
through the `!stop` path: `session/cancel`, the `cancelBackstopMs` force-stop
if the runtime ignores it, and queued messages fail-stopped. A prompt the
runtime rejects with "Session not found" also clears the row's `acpSessionId`,
so the next message opens a fresh session instead of repeating the failure.

### 7.4 Message-to-Execution Flow

```
Slack thread message
 -> ConnectionManager receives Socket Mode event
 -> Normalizer injects traceId -> NormalizedMessage
 -> Local Router selects (agentId, integrationId)
 -> Ensure that agent's ACP adapter is ready, starting if needed
 -> Find/create session by (channel, thread):
      new -> prepareWorkspace -> session/new {cwd, mcpServers:[MCP Tool Server]}
      existing -> reuse / session/load
 -> session/prompt {sessionId, prompt:[text block, attachments...]}
 -> claude-agent-acp drives Claude; session/update streams to ACP Host
 -> ACP Host converges -> translates -> replies through the same Slack connection
 -> For proactive send / other agent, model calls injected MCP tool
No Control Plane on this path; only converged events + metrics report through section 10.
```

For cron, Scheduler constructs a `source:"cron"` synthetic `NormalizedMessage` and starts at Local Router. CP offline does not stop it.

### 7.5 ACP Methods (Local stdio JSON-RPC; ACP Host Client, Adapter Agent)

| Direction       | Method                                    | Purpose                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| client -> agent | `initialize`                              | Negotiate protocol/capabilities, including `fs` and `terminal`.                                                                                     |
| client -> agent | `session/new`                             | Send prepared `cwd` and MCP Tool Server in `mcpServers`.                                                                                            |
| client -> agent | `session/load`                            | Resume a session/thread.                                                                                                                            |

Names and shapes follow ACP and `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`. Internally, the adapter implements the wire methods `session/new`, `session/prompt`, and `session/update` as `newSession`, `prompt`, and `sessionUpdate`. Declaring `mcpServers` in `session/new` is the tool-injection point. A RuntimeDef declaring `sessionMcpServers: 'unsupported'` (OpenClaw's bridge rejects any non-empty list on `session/new` and `session/load`) skips the injection at dispatch and is clamped to `[]` inside `AcpHost` for every other session creator — those sessions run without the AgentConnect tool server or configured MCP servers, the same degraded shape as a session with no reachable bridge.

### 7.6 Webchat Admin MCP

The daemon attaches the CP-hosted administrative MCP catalog only to a private,
user-owned webchat session. Every agent gets it there — no install, no per-agent
setting — and it never attaches to an IM session, automation, or an agent-to-agent
session.

For an entitled webchat turn, the daemon attempts the standard ACP HTTPS
MCP descriptor regardless of runtime id, artifact, version, launch provenance,
capability probe, or sandbox mode. The runtime is already arbitrary executable
code inside its configured boundary, so those properties are compatibility facts,
not an additional security boundary. AgentConnect defines no private ACP
capability or runtime-generated retry header.

Daemon registration advertises `webchat_remote_mcp_v1` whenever confidential
remote-grant delivery is active. The relay delivers only a non-secret entitlement.
The daemon obtains a short-lived opaque grant from the CP over revision-fenced
issue/accept/activate control frames, then first attempts the CP MCP URL and active
Bearer grant on `session/new` or `session/load` as structured runtime configuration.
If the runtime rejects that session configuration, the daemon retries without the
additional descriptor so ordinary webchat can continue. It does not put the grant
in the prompt, proxy MCP requests, mint per-request assertions, or run an
administrative broker.

The runtime calls the standard CP `POST /api/v1/mcp` endpoint directly. The CP
derives the actor from the stored grant and durable webchat owner, re-runs live
authorization, and owns confirmation plus fail-closed at-most-once execution for
every operation with side effects, surfacing uncertain outcomes as explicit
ambiguous terminal states. Standard JSON-RPC request ids index grant-scoped
transport receipts only; CP-owned operation and execution-attempt fences provide
the durable execution identity. Tool catalog execution is therefore a control operation; browser messages and ACP
`session/update` streams remain on the relay↔daemon/daemon-local data path and
never cross the CP.

Administration fails closed. A runtime that rejects the descriptor is retried
without it; a stale or expired generation, unavailable CP, or invalid grant produces
no `agentconnect-admin` descriptor or a bounded tool error. Ordinary webchat and
daemon-local MCP tools continue when the runtime can create or load a descriptor-free
session. The daemon never falls back to its shared MCP socket, daemon API key,
organization principal, user API key, or system-prompt secret.

## 8. Slack-to-Agent Message Routing Rules

Section 6 covers connection consolidation and static rule derivation. This section defines runtime selection of `(agentId, sessionId)` for one inbound event.

### 8.0 Unified `RoutingRule` Model (Two Layers)

There is one rule type:

```ts
interface RoutingRule {
  agentId: string // Local agent.id and CP identifier
  integrationId: string // Daemon-local Slack connection
  scope: { channel?: string; thread?: string } // Missing channel means any
  match: { kind: 'mention' } | { kind: 'dm' } | { kind: 'keyword'; value: string } | { kind: 'auto' }
  source: 'config' | 'cp'
  epoch?: number // CP layer only: routingEpoch fence
}
```

- **Local layer (`source:"config"`):** Derived from `agent.json.slack.bindRules` through `rulesFromAgent`. Always active and authoritative for offline/bootstrap. Legacy migration: `subscribedChannels{trigger:"all"}` -> `{channel, match:auto}`; `trigger:"mention"` -> `{channel, match:mention}`; `mentionAnyChannel` -> unscoped mention; `respondToDms` -> dm.
- **CP layer (`source:"cp"`):** `route/assign` per-sessionKey overrides, `route/update` global rules, and `register/ok` reconcile snapshot. Persist to Local Store and use across restart/disconnect.
- **Priority:** local is baseline, CP overrides by sessionKey, except explicit `@bot` wins across layers.

### 8.1 Routing Inputs

An event arrives on one platform connection with connectionId, event type, channelId, thread_ts, user, text with `<@BOT>` markers, and attachments. The connection already narrows candidates to agents whose integrations use it.

- **scope-candidates:** Rules whose channel/thread scope matches. Ignore kind. Unique agentIds are **reachable agents** for thread gating.
- **kind-candidates:** Scope candidates whose kind matches: mention when `msg.mentionedBots` includes that rule's agent botUserId; dm when `msg.isDm`; case-insensitive keyword in text; auto always.
- Human senders use the complete ladder. For Slack bot senders, compare sender app ID to managed app identity in the collaboration snapshot, with resolved bot user/bot ID fallback on the same daemon. Drop any AgentConnect-managed bot before command/model admission. An unmanaged third-party Slack bot can match only an explicit mention, never DM/thread/keyword/auto. Bot senders on other platforms do not route.

### 8.2 Routing Order (First Match Wins)

```
Event arrives on connectionId
|
|- 0. Pre-filter structural events, managed agent bots, or no-text/no-attachment.
|     Drop third-party Slack bots without an explicit mention of this bot.
|
|- 1. Explicit @bot mention, highest across layers:
|     mention candidate whose bot is in msg.mentionedBots. Beats thread affinity.
|
|- 2. Thread affinity, bypassing kind:
|     if msg.thread and threadOwner(channel,thread) is among reachable agents:
|       - one reachable agent -> continue to owner regardless of kind
|       - multiple reachable agents -> mention-gated; step 1 failed, so activate none
|         and return null; transcript may still record it for catch-up
|     On activation, resume + replay gaps per section 8.5.
|
|- 3. CP per-sessionKey override:
|     if a source:"cp" kind candidate is scoped to msg.channel/thread,
|     select only among CP kind candidates using step 5.
|
|- 4. Local layer where CP does not override channel:
|     select remaining local kind candidates with step 5.
|
|- 5. In-layer priority: mention > dm > keyword > auto.
|     Mention was handled by step 1, leaving dm > keyword > auto.
|
`- 6. No match -> null and drop; authz failures were excluded while building candidates
      and produce audit records.
```

Return `{ agentId, integrationId }` or `null`. For one-reachable-agent thread continuation, use any owner scope-candidate integrationId.

### 8.3 Multi-Agent / Multi-Binding Arbitration

| Situation                                                   | Rule                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Message mentions one specific bot                           | Deliver **only to that agent**, ignoring broad matches; explicit mention wins across layers.           |
| Third-party Slack bot mentions a specific bot               | Permit step 1. Without explicit mention, do not deliver even for auto channel or thread owner.         |
| AgentConnect-managed agent bot sends message                | Never activate through Slack, regardless of mention/auto; agent-to-agent uses internal `messageAgent`. |
| A has channel `auto`, B has broad `mention`                 | Each participates by rule: A consumes auto; B only when mentioned.                                     |
| Thread owner exists, but new message mentions another agent | Explicit mention precedes affinity and transfers the thread, opening/resuming that agent's session.    |
| Local and CP rules both exist for a channel                 | CP overrides local by sessionKey. Skip unserviceable CP agentId and count `degradedScopes`.            |
| CP offline                                                  | Route from local layer only plus persisted CP layer; `register/ok` reconverges after reconnect.        |

This ladder is authoritative for `route()`.

### 8.4 After Match: Normalize and Deliver

1. A mid-thread @ trigger fetches the full thread history as context prefix.
2. Inject `traceId` and normalize to `NormalizedMessage{ source:"user", platform, channel, thread, sender, text, attachments, trigger }`.
3. Find/create session by `(channel, thread, agentId)`, apply section 8.5 continuation/catch-up, and call ACP Host `session/prompt`.

### 8.5 Session Continuation Within a Thread

Several bots and humans can alternate in one thread. Each agent owns its own session there. While an agent is skipped, the thread advances; when mentioned again it must **resume the same session** and **see what happened during the gap**.

- **Session persists while skipped:** X remains `idle`, not closed.
- **Thread transcript + per-session marker:** Local Store orders all messages. X records `lastDeliveredTs`. Even a human-only or other-bot message that activates no agent enters transcript.
- **Catch-up replay on activation:** When routing selects X, read all messages after `lastDeliveredTs`, including other-bot/human turns, prepend them as context to the current prompt, use `session/load` if necessary, and advance marker to current.
- **Cross-agent context uses transcript, never a shared ACP session:** Each agent has an independent session; shared visibility comes entirely from text replay.

Example:

```
1) First message in thread A mentions BotA.
   -> Create S_A; BotA handles it; markerA advances.
2) Reply mentions BotB or a human.
   -> BotB creates/resumes S_B while S_A remains idle and markerA does not move.
   -> A human-only reply activates no agent but is stored in transcript.
3) Thread A mentions BotA again.
   -> Resume S_A, prepend every message after markerA, including BotB/human traffic,
      append current prompt, and advance markerA.
```

If S_A closed by TTL, use `session/load`; on failure, start a new session but still replay transcript for continuity.

### 8.6 Routing Non-User Sources (Bypasses)

- **Cron/loop:** Scheduler constructs `source:"cron"` with explicit agent, bypassing matching. With target channel, daemon first posts trigger text as a real anchor and replies in its thread; without target, run headless with no platform output and record only in the transcript.
- **`sendPlatformMessage` / `messageAgent`:** Active outbound tools. If a platform message reaches another subscribed agent's channel, it re-enters section 8.2 as a new inbound event, enabling platform-mediated collaboration.
- **Session commands:** `!stop` / `!queue` are intercepted by `parseCommand` before section 8.2, never prompt or transcript.

### 8.7 CP-Layer Mechanism and Persistence (`CpRoutingLayer`)

`CpRoutingLayer` persists through Local Store and is driven by `cp/client.ts` through `ConfigApply`:

- State: `routingEpoch`, `assignments: Map<sessionKeyStr, RoutingRule[]>` where `sessionKeyStr = ${platform}:${channel}:${thread ?? "-"}`, and `globalRules`. `effectiveRules()` flattens CP rules for merging with local.
- **`route/assign {sessionKey, agentId, bindRules}`:** Expand rules scoped to sessionKey as `source:"cp"`, resolve integration as below, upsert/persist assignment, return `route/assign/ack {ok:true, sessionKey}`.
- **`route/update {routingEpoch, rules[]}` EVT:** When `routingEpoch >= cached`, replace `globalRules`, set each rule's `epoch=routingEpoch`, bump the epoch, and persist. Otherwise ignore and log the stale update. Parse `rules[].match` as a `BindRule` match; skip and log malformed items.
- **`register/ok.assignments[]`:** Converge exactly to snapshot, apply `drop.assignments`, adopt epoch, persist.
- **agentId local resolution:** `agent.json.id` equals CP agentId. Resolve a Slack integration at match time. Missing agent/integration remains stored but unserviceable, warned, and counted degraded; hot addition makes it serviceable.
- **Autonomy:** During restart/disconnect, route with local layer + last persisted CP layer. Local layer is rederived at startup.

Wire stale-epoch fencing (`epoch < sessionEpoch`) and routingEpoch are independent version dimensions.

### 8.8 In-Session Commands (`!stop` / `!queue`)

Some thread messages control the running agent rather than prompt it. `parseCommand` from `commands/commands.ts` intercepts them in `onInbound` **before routing**; they enter neither transcript nor model.

- **Prefix:** Slack reserves slash commands, so use `!`; also parse `/` for Telegram/Discord. Command must immediately follow prefix; `hello!` and `! note` are normal text.
- **Vocabulary:** `!stop` / `!cancel` interrupt current turn; `!queue <text>` runs text after idle.

Run `route()` on the command to locate `(agentId, integrationId)`, preserving thread affinity and conversation admission. If no target, ignore and log.

- **`!stop` / `!cancel`:** For an in-flight session, first clear its queue, then send ACP `session/cancel`, and reply `🛑 Stopped.`. If nothing is running, reply `Nothing is running to stop.`
- **`!queue <text>`:** If busy, enqueue stripped text in `queued: Map<acpSessionId, NormalizedMessage[]>` and reply `📥 Queued`; if idle, dispatch immediately. On clean turn completion, FIFO-dispatch one queued message, which chains the next. On prompt error, do not dispatch; retain the queue.

This is daemon-local and bypasses CP. It differs from CP `agent/stop`, which stops the whole agent process, and continues in degraded mode.

## 9. Platform Message Translation: ACP <-> Slack / Telegram / Discord / Lark / Feishu

Two directions are implemented: outbound ACP `session/update` -> platform,
inbound platform -> ACP content, plus active MCP send. Slack, Telegram,
Discord, and Lark / Feishu use the common platform-driver boundary.

### 9.1 Outbound: ACP `session/update` -> Slack (Convergence + Translation)

Goal: **channel contains only start / plan / problem / finish + link**, while details remain in Web App. ACP Host converges streaming updates through the mode-aware `OutputConverger` in `packages/daemon/src/slack/render.ts`; outbound writes are serialized by `PlatformSendQueue` in `packages/daemon/src/platforms/send-queue.ts`.

**`medium` / `high` message-style progress:**

| ACP update                       | Slack translation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_message_chunk`            | `OutputConverger` buffers text until the daemon's approximately 2-second idle flush; `splitIntoSections()` in `slack/formatter.ts` splits blocks <=12000 characters before posting native CommonMark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `agent_thought_chunk`            | `high` only: context block, edit later thought in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `tool_call` / `tool_call_update` | `OutputConverger` flushes pending body text, updates transient status, emits in-place progress in `medium`/`high`, and emits terminal tool output once in `high`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `plan`                           | In-place bulleted list (`renderPlan`): completed entries struck through, the entry in flight bolded, a `Plan · n/m` heading, ruled top and bottom. Deliberately not Block Kit `checkboxes` — that element is an INPUT with no read-only variant, so it offers a click that can do nothing, and it caps at 10 options / 150 characters per label, both enforced rather than truncated. A rich-text list has neither limit. |

| `stopReason`                     | Completion message + Web App session link.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

**`low` default:** Keep only agent body text, the plan, and the final result as channel messages — the plan is the shortest statement of what the turn is for, and low being the DEFAULT is why it is not withheld here. All other activity signals use the transient agent-session working state ([`agents.sessions.setStatus`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/agents.sessions.setStatus)), not chat messages. The enum carries no custom text: a non-empty status maps to `processing` (Slack renders "is working…" plus the native Stop control in the DM container), a clear maps to `active`.

| ACP update                       | Low-mode action                                                                                                                            |

- Status sequence: any non-empty label (cold start, thinking, tool title) keeps the session `processing`; `''` transitions it to `active`. The connection dedupes writes per (channel, thread, identity), so a turn produces one `processing` and one `active` regardless of how many labels stream through. `dispatch()` checks cold state before `sessions.handle()` boots host.
- **One slot, many turns:** Slack keeps ONE agent-session status per (app, channel, thread) — no session id in the API, no agent field on `agent_session_stopped` — while participant fan-out legitimately runs sibling turns against it. A turn leaving the slot (finish, failure, cancel, stop target) therefore SETTLES it instead of clearing: the newest surviving sibling's `processing` is re-asserted under its own identity (verified live: a fresh `processing` also resolves a pending "Stopping…" back into a working row), and only an empty thread transitions to `active`. The native Stop targets the turn the row is naming — on the Socket arm, where one daemon owns every turn the bot runs, the connection tracks the last `processing` writer as the slot's displayed owner and cancels that one turn (fallback: the thread's newest session, cold gate keys included); the survivor then takes the row over, so stopping B hands the row back to a still-working A. The relay-forwarded arm reaches every participant daemon, whose per-daemon settlements could disagree over the one global slot, so it keeps the globally consistent all-stop (cancel every local turn, final write `active`) until displayed ownership has a cross-daemon authority. A turn displaced by a newer message leaves the slot alone — it belongs to its successor, whose admission-time `processing` is the last write.
- **Best effort:** Wrap `setStatus` in try/catch with debug logging.
  `chat:write` suffices for the enum; failures do not interrupt dispatch and
  have no fallback message. `status:''` clears the indicator.
- **Slack identity/title:** Agent/assistant DM session title uses `agents.sessions.rename`. The working indicator and agent body messages carry `username`/`icon_url`, preferring trimmed `displayName` then `name`, requiring `chat:write.customize`; Slack keeps the session-status identity sticky until rewritten, so the dedupe key includes it. System chrome—permission/elicitation cards, failures/notices—keeps Slack App identity. For an old install with exact `missing_scope(chat:write.customize)`: body messages retry without username, cool down to app identity, and periodically probe authorization; the working indicator retries without identity and latches it off for the connection's lifetime (a reconnect re-probes).

**`none` mode:** Full body still records in session transcript through a `recordOnly` post handled before checking platform connection, but send nothing to IM. Reuse headless/webchat's `replyConn = undefined`; activity/status/typing/reply/footer are all no-op. Background completion notifications gated at `≥ medium` do not fire.

Thread semantics: main progress goes at the thread anchor or, for a subscribed thread, uses `thread_ts`; tool-output messages reply in the same thread. `PlatformSendQueue` rate-limits API calls, including the `chat.postMessage` Tier3 limit of 50rpm. The effective output mode is the per-session override when present, otherwise `agent.output.mode`.

### 9.2 Inbound Attachments -> ACP `session/prompt` Content

- Extract text from `app_mention` / `message`. For a mid-thread @mention, `SlackConnection.getThreadReplies()` in `packages/daemon/src/slack/connection.ts` fetches the full thread through `conversations.replies`, and `SessionManager` uses that snapshot as prompt context.
- Download attachment bytes from `files.url_private` with bot token and create ACP `image` / `resource` blocks.
- Decode a relay-delivered, size-bounded webchat image locally and feed it through the same ACP attachment-block builder. Keep the bounded image only in the daemon-local transcript so an authorized console history read can display it again; the Control Plane proxies that read without persisting the bytes.
- Normalize to `NormalizedMessage`, then `session/prompt`.

### 9.3 Telegram / Discord / Lark / Feishu Mapping (Implemented)

Drivers implement `{ open, close, reply(threadRef, content), sendMessage(target, content), normalizeInbound(event) }`. ACP convergence is platform-independent; only final rendering differs.

| Capability   | Slack                           | Telegram               | Discord                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Receive      | Socket Mode WS                  | long polling / webhook | gateway WS                 |
| Thread model | `thread_ts`                     | reply message / topic  | thread / message reference |
| Rich text    | Block Kit `markdown` CommonMark | MarkdownV2 / HTML      | markdown / embed           |
| Active send  | `chat.postMessage`              | `sendMessage`          | channel webhook / REST     |
| Limit        | <=12000 per markdown block      | split at 4096          | split at 2000              |

Lark / Feishu uses the same interface with a direct `WSClient` or an HTTP-mode
send-only SDK client under `src/feishu/`; see
[feishu-integration.md](feishu-integration.md).

### 9.4 Active Send / Agent-to-Agent: MCP Tool Injection

ACP can only reply to the current thread. Daemon's **MCP Tool Server** adds proactive platform send / agent calls. Declare it in `session/new.mcpServers`; platform tokens remain in the connection and invisible to the agent.

Implemented tools in `src/mcp/tools.ts`: the unified `sendMessage` (which absorbed the
former `sendPlatformMessage` and `messageAgent`); collaboration `listAgents` (deprecated
alias `listChannelAgents`) and `viewSessionStatus`; channel/user information
`getCurrentChannel`, `listChannels`, `listKnownUsers`, `listChannelMembers`,
`getUserProfile`; attachment readers `readSlackFile`, `readTelegramFile`;
memory `readMemory`, `writeMemory`, `searchMemory`; and others.

A second group is gated by a **declared port** rather than by a platform name
(`platforms/read-ports.ts`, §7.1 of
[integration-plugin-architecture.md](integration-plugin-architecture.md)): the bounded reads
`getChannelHistory` and `getThreadHistory`, the reactions `addReaction` / `getReactions`,
`createConversation`, `scheduleMessage`, and the canvas trio `createCanvas` / `readCanvas` /
`updateCanvas`. Slack declares all of them today and is the only platform that does. The gate
is the **session's** platform, not the agent's integration list: a session on a declaring
platform is injected the tools, and the same agent answering on Telegram, Discord, Feishu, or
webchat is injected none — so these tools carry no `platform` selector at all, only the
`integrationId` that picks another of the agent's bots on the same platform. The
platform-neutral reads (`listChannels`, `listChannelMembers`, `getUserProfile`,
`listKnownUsers`) and `sendMessage` keep their cross-platform `platform` argument; a
platform-shaped capability reached from another platform's session was never asked for, and
it cost every other session the descriptors. Two rules keep this group honest. It is not a second
delivery path — `sendMessage` and `shareFile` remain the only two, and `scheduleMessage` is
channel-root only for the same reason `sendMessage` is
([send-message-routing-rework.md](send-message-routing-rework.md) §2.2). And unlike the turn
chrome, each of these reports the platform's own refusal verbatim, because the agent asked
for it: an installation whose grant predates a capability scope must see `missing_scope`, not
a silent success.

`searchPublicMessages` carries two constraints the others do not.

The first is a credential. A BOT token may search only through Slack's Data Access API
(`assistant.search.context`), which refuses without the ephemeral `action_token` Slack attaches
to the events where the app is addressed — verified against a real workspace, where a request
with the scopes but no token answers `invalid_action_token`. That token is a CREDENTIAL, and
the normalized message it arrives on is persisted to the durable inbox and replayed after a
restart, so it is never normalized onto the message. Ingress lifts it into the platform
adapter's memory (bounded, with a TTL, since Slack documents no lifetime); the daemon holds
only the triggering message's id as the turn's search authorization, and the adapter resolves
id → credential internally. On the HTTP transport the relay saw the event instead, so it
forwards the token BESIDE `rd/msg`'s `payload` — never inside it — and the daemon hands it
straight to the adapter. One consequence is user-visible: a turn nothing addressed (a cron run,
an agent-to-agent wake) cannot search and says so.

The second is reach, and it is the provider's, not ours. A bot search reaches PUBLIC channels
across the workspace — including channels the app was never added to — and nothing else. That
was measured against a real workspace rather than read off the scope table, because the scope
table is wrong in both directions:

- Slack's reference calls `search:read.private` / `.im` / `.mpim` user-token only. A workspace
  grants all three to a BOT.
- Granting them buys nothing. With the bot a MEMBER of a private channel, a message posted
  there was never returned — not with `channel_types: ['private_channel']`, not with all four
  surfaces, not with `channel_types` omitted entirely. A DM to the app behaved the same way:
  its text matched nothing at all, while a semantically similar public message matched twenty.

So the manifest requests `search:read.public` only. Asking an admin to approve searching
private channels and DMs in exchange for zero retrieved content is the worst kind of permission
request, and the three scopes were dropped once the measurements came in. The search scopes ride
in the single `SLACK_BOT_SCOPES` list and arrive WITH this tool, which is that list's own rule:
a scope there makes every existing install incomplete, so it may only land alongside the
capability that calls it.

Two narrowing arguments were measured and found not to narrow: `channel_types` returns public
content when asked for `private_channel`, and `context_channel_id` produced results identical
to omitting it. Neither may be described to an agent as a filter, and an earlier revision that
bound the tool to its own conversation had to be reverted — a bot cannot search the private
channel or DM it is talking in, so binding returned an empty list in exactly the places an
agent is most often addressed.

Its RESULTS are governed too. Slack's Real-time Search API states that data retrieved from it
must not be stored or copied, while every other tool result is ordinary transcript material —
so the search result is stamped, and `session/ephemeral-results.ts` is what the transcript
recorder consults: a body carrying the marker keeps its call, status and the agent's own query
and loses what the search retrieved. Detection is a SUBSTRING SCAN of the serialized body
rather than a field path, because a runtime may echo a tool result in `rawOutput`, in `content`
blocks, or nested inside either, and a check pinned to one shape would pass while the data left
through another. The same constraint binds the agent, which the tool description states: use
the hits in the reply, do not copy them into memory, a canvas, or a file.

**The boundary this reaches is AgentConnect's own durable state, and no further.** The result
is delivered through the ACP runtime, which keeps its own conversation history — `session/load`
replays that whole historical tool stream — so a copy outlives the turn in a store the daemon
does not own, and ACP offers no way to mark a tool result unpersistable. Every claim made to
the agent and in the console is therefore worded as "AgentConnect keeps no copy", never "no copy
is kept".

That remaining copy is judged acceptable rather than closed, and the reasoning is worth keeping
because it is inference. Slack positions this API as LLM context and ships its own MCP server on
it to AI clients whose conversations are equally durable, so the same copy exists wherever that
product is used as designed; and Slack names the harm as storing customer data on external
servers, which is what the redacted transcript was and what a model's working context is not.
Supporting asymmetry: the legacy user-token `search.messages` carries no such clause at all.
None of that is an explicit safe harbour for durable runtime history, so two things stand.
**Confirm the reading with Slack before distributing this beyond first-party use**, and keep the
fallback scoped: gate the tool on the runtime advertising `sessionCapabilities.delete` and drop
the session after a turn that searched (`AcpHost.deleteSession`, defined but not yet wired),
which trades session continuity for a proven no-retention boundary.

Two more families join on the same port mechanism. **Bookmarks** (`listBookmarks` /
`addBookmark` / `removeBookmark`) pin links at the top of a conversation; the write tool says
plainly that a bookmark outlives the task, because it is channel-visible state an agent can
create and the model needs that in view. Only `type: 'link'` is offered — Slack's other
bookmark kinds name existing entities by an id a model has no way to hold.

**Lists** (`readList` / `addListItem` / `updateListItem`) reach Slack's structured lists, and
they repeat the canvas lesson exactly: a value is addressed by `column_id` and keyed by that
column's TYPE, and Slack publishes no schema endpoint for a list. So the columns are derived
from the rows a read returns and handed back with them — the read is not a convenience before
the write, it is the only source of the ids and types the write needs.

Three scopes in that same change had NO caller and said so: `channels:join`, `team:read`, and
`users:read.email`. That is a deliberate exception to the scope-arrives-with-its-feature rule,
taken because one list means every scope addition costs a reinstall of every installation —
batching the ones already in view is one reinstall instead of three. The exception is worth
making once, with the reason recorded, and is not a precedent for declaring scopes speculatively.
`channels:join` has since found its caller (channel reach, below); the two directory reads still wait.

**Channel reach.** Slack requires bot membership for `conversations.history` / `.replies` and
`chat.postMessage` even in a public channel, and a bot is a member only of the channels a human
added it to — so for a long time `getChannelHistory` read the session's own channel only and
`getThreadHistory` / `sendMessage` failed with `not_in_channel` anywhere else. Two pieces change
that, and their split is the point. The **connection** joins a PUBLIC channel on demand
(`joiningOnRefusal` in `slack/connection.ts`: a call refused with `not_in_channel` is retried
exactly once after `conversations.join`, `channels:join`; the join cannot enter a private channel,
DM or group DM, so there the original refusal surfaces). The **ops layer** decides what a tool may
reach beyond the session's own conversation (`mcp/ops/channel-reach.ts`), on a platform that
declares `publicChannelReach` in `read-ports.ts`: a public channel is open, while a private
channel, DM or group DM is reachable only when it IS the conversation the agent was invoked in.
Membership is not consent — a bot invited into a private channel for one purpose must not make
that channel readable from every other conversation the same agent is in. The gate reads the
platform's own description (`conversations.info`) rather than the id's shape, and lets a
conversation the platform will not describe through to the platform's own, more precise refusal.
It sits in front of `getChannelHistory` (which gained `channel` / `integrationId` like
`getThreadHistory`), `getThreadHistory`, and every `channel` form of `sendMessage`; the `toUser`
DM form names a user, not a channel, and is not gated. Slack's `listChannels` enumerates every
public channel of the workspace (`conversations.list`) plus the private channels the bot is in, so
an agent can find the id of a channel it was never added to; the console's membership snapshot
stays `listBotChannels`. Platforms that declare nothing keep their previous reach.

The orchestration triple `startOrchestration` / `getOrchestration` /
`cancelOrchestration` is **retired from the injected tool surface**: its send half
duplicated `sendMessage` (fan-out to N workers is N `sendMessage` calls with
`toAgent.needsReply`) and its status half duplicated `viewSessionStatus`. The descriptors
live on in `RETIRED_ORCHESTRATION_TOOLS` and `executeTool` still dispatches them, so
sessions already warm with the old descriptors and still-open orchestration records keep
resolving — but no agent is offered them. The daemon-side machinery below (durable
records, correlation recording, the re-armed deadline wake) is unchanged; the deadline is
the one capability `sendMessage(needsReply)` cannot yet express and is kept so
`needsReply` can gain an optional deadline on top of it.

`listAgents` is **org**-scoped, not channel-scoped: it issues `channel/agents` with
no channel and gets back every peer in the organization that the directional call
policy admits, so a session with no IM integration (webchat, webhook, dreaming,
memory-only) can still discover and wake peers. A `channel` argument is an optional
filter. Authorization for a wake is that same call policy, evaluated against the
daemon's copy of the collaboration snapshot (`CpCollabRoutes.admits`, fail-closed on
an unknown agent); `channel` remains only the session/delivery coordinate — but as that
coordinate it is checked for **integrity**: a recorded coordinate must have the caller in
its membership, an unrecorded one on a persisted IM platform is refused, and an unrecorded
one on a channel-free platform is replaced by the caller-derived `a2a:<callerAgentId>`
before the session key is minted. See
[agent-collaboration-implementation.md](agent-collaboration-implementation.md) §2.2/§2.5
and [daemon-cp-ws-protocol.md](daemon-cp-ws-protocol.md) §7.7.

### 9.5 A Bridge Tool Asks Its Own Host (MCP-side elicitation)

On the ACP wire we are the CLIENT: the coding agent asks, and every chat surface renders the
card. On the MCP wire the role is reversed — the daemon is the SERVER — so a tool that lacks
information can ask the agent's OWN host (Claude Code, Codex) instead of guessing. The ROLE
reverses; the renderer does not. Both harnesses we ship forward any MCP server's elicitation
onto the ACP wire, ours included, so the ask comes back to the daemon that issued it and lands
on the same card #1794 built — measured under our own reserved server name in
[mcp-elicitation.md](mcp-elicitation.md) §5.6, which also records what that costs.

`capabilities.elicitation` is a CLIENT capability and no server may declare it: the bridge's
`{ capabilities: { tools: {} } }` is already correct. What the bridge does instead is READ the
client's declaration and pass it to the daemon on every `callTool` frame. The capability test
is the server SDK's own lenient pre-mode rule — a bare `elicitation: {}` counts as form support
— because the Claude harness declares exactly that; a strict `elicitation.form` read would
silently disable every ask on that runtime while codex kept working.

The mechanism is a RETURN VALUE, never a daemon→bridge request. `src/mcp/ask.ts` reduces a
tool's question to MCP's restricted flat-object schema; `askHost` throws `AskRequired`;
`McpControlServer` answers the frame with an `mcpAsk` marker; the bridge turns that into the
SDK's `input_required` result, which on this 2025-era connection the SDK's own shim fulfils as
a server→client `elicitation/create` before re-calling the tool with the answer. The daemon's
MCP IPC has ONE undiscriminated id space minted only by the bridge, so an inverted direction
would collide with a live tool call's id.

Four rules the seam enforces:

- **The emitted `requestedSchema` carries no root key beyond `type`/`properties`/`required`.**
  codex re-parses it with a deny-unknown-fields type, and a root-level `title` alone kills the
  forward inside codex core before ACP ever sees it. `title`, `description`, `enum` and
  `oneOf` are property-level, which is where a card renders them from anyway.
- **The guard against an old bridge is structural, not per-tool.** The in-sandbox bridge is the
  runtime IMAGE's bundle and ships on the image's cadence, so image skew is the normal case. A
  tool can only mint an ask through `deps.ask`, and `McpControlServer` creates that port only
  when THIS frame declared a form-capable host — so an old bridge, which sends no `ask`, can
  never receive a marker it would JSON.stringify straight to the model.
- **A tool may only ask BEFORE it does observable work, or must be safe to replay.** The answer
  arrives on a fresh `tools/call` that re-runs the whole handler: the turn gate, the evaluation
  dispatch, the memory approval gate and the tool body.
- **A decline is a usable outcome, not an exception**, and the ask leg's timeout is pinned well
  under the SDK's 600s default. An ask is human-paced, so the turn can die while it is open;
  the replayed round then hits the turn gate first and refuses, posting nothing.

The mechanism landed with no product call site of its own; the guesses the audit found are
removed from here on.

Two of the obvious-looking candidates are not guesses at all. `shareFile` takes NO destination
by design (§3 of [agent-authored-attachments.md](agent-authored-attachments.md)) — the model
cannot name one, which is the whole authorization argument for the tool. And `sendMessage`'s
target channel is required input: a missing one is a loud refusal naming the five valid target
shapes, not an inference.

`sendMessage` is out of this seam's scope entirely, by product decision. It is the one tool
here whose effect is visible and irreversible, so putting any card in front of a human to steer
it is a product question [product-conventions.md](../product-conventions.md) would have to
admit first; it is filed separately, and the send path raises no card. Search scope stays open.

The first class of ask is a READ that cannot pick a bot. `listKnownUsers` and `listChannels`'s
observed-history fallback answered an agent with more than one bot on the platform with an empty
list plus a note telling the model to re-call with an `integrationId` it had no way to obtain.
They ask instead, over a trusted enum and behind one shared guard, `ambiguousIntegrations`: this
session's own bot is the tiebreak, because the ids a read returns have to be reachable by the bot
an unqualified `sendMessage` then picks — which is that same bot. So a same-platform multi-bot
session asks nothing and reads its own bot's history (strictly better than the empty list it used
to get), and the ask is left to the case that has no tiebreak at all: a cross-platform read where
the agent has several bots on the target platform and none of them owns this conversation.

Making that answer matter needed a prerequisite in the same change: `observedChannels`/
`observedUsers` took only `(agentId, platform)`, so a named bot had nowhere to go — they now take
an `integrationId`, and the daemon resolves it to that ONE bot's `transportScope`, which is what
the session store's history has always been keyed by (a session that spanned several bots carries a
`mixed:` scope and belongs to none of them). Three consequences worth stating: an explicitly passed
`integrationId` now scopes the fallback too — the very repair the note asks for used to return the
note again; `listChannels` asks ABOVE its live enumeration rather than below it (the second class,
next), so the asking round spends no platform API call at all; and an answer lives only in the SDK's per-call
state, so a later `tools/call` asks the same human again — accepted, and softened by reporting an
empty human-disambiguated read as _that bot's_ empty history rather than as a platform-wide `[]`
the model would want to retry. That last consequence is also why a result scoped to one bot names it
back as `integrationId`: the answer itself dies with the call, so without the id in the result the
model would hold chat ids it could only reach through a bot the next unqualified call does not pick.
That applies to `listChannels`' LIVE branch as much as to its observed one — a live channel list is
one bot's ids too, and moving the ask above the enumeration (below) is what first makes a
human-chosen bot's live list reachable — so both branches name the bot on one rule: omitted only
where nothing was picked, which is a single bot on that platform, the one an unqualified follow-up
resolves to anyway. Where the ask cannot be made or is declined, both reads fall through to the exact
suppressed result, note included.

The second class is the resolution itself. `resolveGatewayForPlatform` ended in
`candidates.find((i) => i.id === ctx.integrationId) ?? candidates[0]`: for a same-platform call the
first arm keeps the session put, which is the right answer, but for a genuine cross-platform call
with several bots on the target platform the fallback took whichever came first, silently. That was
the audit's only silent WRONG answer — everything else unresolved in the bridge either throws or
defaults to something a tool descriptor documents. The resolver can now ask instead, behind the same
`ambiguousIntegrations` guard, which stops about fifteen read and action tools guessing at once.
The `ctx.platform` action tools are inside that set, not outside it: `ctx.integrationId` is optional
(a memory-only turn, a cron wake, a session resumed after a restart registers without one), so a
session that NO bot owns makes the guard non-empty on its own platform too — which is why the
port-gated tools' `integrationId` descriptor promises the ask as well.

The ask is OPT-IN, and that is the load-bearing part. `resolveGatewayForPlatform` asks only for a
call site that passed `ask: true`; every other one of its ~16 callers keeps today's first-candidate
pick BY CONSTRUCTION, rather than by remembering to switch a default off. An opt-out default would
mean any call site added later silently acquires a human-facing card — which is exactly the failure
this seam already produced once, on `listChannelMembers`. `sendMessage` is the one caller that does
not opt in, and it is untouched by this change: its effect is visible and irreversible, so a card
that steers it is a product question [product-conventions.md](../product-conventions.md) would have
to admit first, filed separately.

The ask lives in the resolver, not at its call sites. The function is synchronous and returns
`{ gw, integrationId, sameConvo }`; making it async-and-three-outcomes would oblige every caller to
propagate a question it has nothing to say about. `AskRequired` is already a typed sentinel
`McpControlServer` catches centrally, so the helper raises it and stays synchronous — a call site
that opts in adds one option, nothing more.

A question the ask must not put is one no answer can repair, and the general rule is positional: a
refusal derived from the ARGUMENTS ALONE reads the same whichever bot the human names, so it belongs
ABOVE the ask. Its sharpest form is the channel default — a call whose `channel` defaults in only for
this session's own bot (`listChannelMembers`, `getThreadHistory`, the reaction/bookmark/schedule
tools) cannot be repaired by ANY answer when no channel was named, because the ask fires exactly when
no candidate owns this conversation, which is exactly when `channel` becomes required. So
`askOnlyWithChannel` opts in only when a channel was named. The same rule hoisted the argument checks
of `createConversation` (`name`/`users`), `scheduleMessage` (`postAt` and its two bounds) and
`updateCanvas` (per-edit shape) above their resolve: each otherwise spent a card, and one of the two
rounds the bridge allows, to arrive at the message the call always gave.

The offered enum is the trusted session snapshot and NOTHING else — in particular not the subset
whose connection happens to be live. `gatewayFor` may rotate, so a liveness-filtered offer is
computed from a value that can differ between the round that mints the card and the round that
carries its answer: pick B, lose B's connection while the card is open, and the answering round finds
B outside its freshly filtered enum, discards it as un-offered, and acts as A — the silent wrong bot
this ask exists to remove, on the visible-effect tools too. The offer is therefore round-stable, the
untrusted-input guard still refuses any id outside the snapshot, and a chosen bot that cannot act by
the time the answer lands fails with the ordinary `no live connection` naming the id the human chose
— the same error an explicit `integrationId` would have got. It is also what lets the resolver and
the history-backed reads share one key honestly: both legs now offer the identical set.

ONE key per platform per tool call (`integrationId.<platform>`), shared by the resolver and the
history-backed reads. The key is shared; the MESSAGE is not — it is read only on the round that
mints the ask, so each caller passes the verb phrase the card names ("list channels", "react to a
message") and the human is told which decision they are making. `listChannels` does both — resolve a
gateway, then maybe fall back to observed history — and the bridge allows two rounds per call, so a
second, differently-keyed question would arrive on a round that can no longer ask. Sharing the key
also deleted a workaround: the read-the-answer-before-enumerating pre-check existed only because the
ask used to sit BELOW the live call, so a replayed round would spend it twice. The ask now sits
above it, and the answering round spends exactly one platform call — on the bot the human named.

A decline, a cancel, an answer naming an id we never offered, and a host that cannot render a card
all keep the first-candidate pick, so nothing changes for a runtime without elicitation.

A third-party MCP server's own elicitation is a separate question and needs no work here: it
already reaches our chat surfaces by the same route, where `AcpHost` answers
`client/elicitation/create` and the permission coordinator renders the card. It is
distinguishable from Codex's MCP-tool approval by the frame itself — no `toolCallId`, no
`_meta.codex_approval_kind` — but NOT from our own bridge's ask: the forwarded frame carries no
server identity at all, so nothing downstream may branch on which server asked.

## 10. WebSocket Client Interaction with Control Plane

The connection carries orchestration, control, and telemetry plus scoped,
bounded request/reply reads of daemon-local session, tool-body, memory, and
workspace data. Those reads are proxied to an authorized BFF caller without
Control Plane persistence. Live platform messages and ACP update streams stay
on the daemon or relay data plane.

### 10.1 Connection and Authentication

`packages/daemon/src/cp/client.ts` owns the CP connection FSM, frame dispatch,
and protocol codec integration; `config-apply.ts` applies CP-owned state.
Reusable `Transport` and `ReqRep` mechanics live in
`@agentconnect.md/connection`, while `decodeEnvelope`, `buildEnvelope`,
`encode`, `MAX_FRAME_BYTES`, and `InboundControlExt` live in
`@agentconnect.md/protocol` as the single wire truth.

- Daemon **dials out** one WebSocket to `controlPlane.url`, subprotocol `agentconnect.v1`, NAT/edge friendly.
- `CpClient.start()` is **nonblocking, local-first**: starts the background connection loop and returns. CP unreachability or auth failure does not block/fail `Daemon.start()`.
- FSM: `CONNECTING -> AUTHENTICATING -> REGISTERING -> READY -> (DRAINING) -> CLOSED`, plus offline `DEGRADED`.
- First frame is `auth{ apiKey, agentVersion, daemonId?, resume? }` using the opaque token at `config.json.controlPlane.key`. `auth/ok` supplies `sessionEpoch` / `heartbeatSec` and authoritative `daemonId`; `onDaemonId` writes it to config when needed. 4401 invalid/revoked/expired/user-key-on-WS terminates without retry; 1011 transient DB/internal errors retry.
- After auth, send `register`; apply `register/ok` snapshot, adopt `routingEpoch`, enter READY.
- Backoff is built-in 1s -> 30s + jitter, with application heartbeat load snapshot and ping/pong. Close 4401 stops; 4409 epoch conflict reconnects with full register; 4429/1011/1012/drop retry. Drop enters DEGRADED.
- Inbound fencing: `epoch < sessionEpoch` -> `error STALE_EPOCH`; control before READY -> `error PROTOCOL_STATE`.
- **`probeAuth` in `packages/cli/src/cp/auth-probe.ts`:** `login` reuses `ClientTransport` + `ReqRep`, sends only auth, closes after `auth/ok{daemonId}` success or returns `{ok:false, reason}` on 4401/error/dial/timeout. It is self-contained and never hangs. Persist credentials only on success.

Metrics and traces use the direct **OTLP side path** bootstrapped by `OTEL_*`,
not the Control Plane WebSocket. Only `usage/report` and `facts/*` use the
control channel.

**Downstream, CP -> daemon:** Agent specs, integrations, crons, and `config/push` stay in memory; routes and the other explicitly durable control state follow their per-frame policies below.

  "capabilities": {
    "platforms": ["slack", "telegram", "discord", "feishu"], // Implemented platform drivers
    "runtimes": ["claude", "codex"], // Object.keys(resolveRuntimes); validate executables at startup
    "acp": true,
    "features": ["session-visibility-v1", "webchat_remote_mcp_v1"] // Advertised when confidential remote-grant delivery is active.
  },
  "maxAgents": 32,
  "localState": {
    // What the daemon currently believes it holds, used for reconciliation
    "assignments": ["slack:C0TEAM:-"], // Session keys currently being served
    "crons": ["daily-health"], // Registered cron IDs
    "leases": [], // Held lease IDs
    "agents": [{ "agentId": "...", "origin": "cp" }], // On-disk replicas + source markers
    "integrations": [{ "integrationId": "...", "origin": "cp" }] // On-disk replicas + source markers
  }
}
```

The Control Plane returns an **authoritative full snapshot** in `register/ok`
for agents, integrations, crons, assignments, relays, and other desired state.
The daemon converges the snapshot, and explicit `drop.*` entries prune stale
Control Plane-owned replicas on reconnect. See section 3.3 of
[daemon-cp-ws-protocol.md](daemon-cp-ws-protocol.md).

### 10.4 Degradation and Reconnect

WebSocket drop -> CP-Client enters DEGRADED and reconnects with backoff. Daemon remains autonomous: platform connections, active/resumed sessions, crons, and local + persisted CP routing continue. New CP orchestration pauses. Reconnect `register` with resume, then converge `register/ok`.

### 10.5 Delegated Admin-MCP Operations

This feature is on by default on the CP; enablement is gated on the daemon
advertising `webchat_remote_mcp_v1`. Before deploying, ship compatible CP,
relay, daemon, and runtime builds; verify the live authority predicate,
credential redaction, exact grant revocation, revision-fenced descriptor
activation, and CP-owned operation idempotency; then confirm live registration
advertises both `session-visibility-v1` and `webchat_remote_mcp_v1`.

No OS sandbox package, Linux kernel setting, runtime identity/version/provenance,
capability probe, private ACP field, or runtime-generated idempotency header is a
feature prerequisite. Runtime integration coverage verifies standard descriptor
installation and replacement as a compatibility check, not an admission gate;
CP-owned operations provide the write execution fence.

Start with a canary and observe grant, descriptor, request, operation, and
confirmation metrics. Labels are closed outcomes/reasons only; they exclude user,
organization, agent, conversation, grant, operation, token, Authorization header,
request body, tool arguments, response body, and transcript values.

Rollback rolls the daemon back to a build that does not advertise
`webchat_remote_mcp_v1` (stopping new establishment) and invokes the bounded
active-grant revocation path. Ordinary webchat continues. Emergency containment
can revoke one grant, conversation, user, agent, organization, or all feature
grants without isolating a daemon.

The complete staged procedure and stable metric labels are in
[`webchat-preset-agentconnect-mcp.md` §13](webchat-preset-agentconnect-mcp.md#13-capability-and-rollout)
and
[`§14`](webchat-preset-agentconnect-mcp.md#14-observability).

**Open questions:**

1. Arbitration when many agents bind one channel; sections 8.2/8.3 define rules, but real multi-agent cases need load testing.
2. Session affinity and lossless rebalance; drain exists, migration remains undecided.
3. Initial daemonId mint versus Control Plane correction.
4. Credential management: daemon-to-Control-Plane uses a long-lived revocable
   **CP API key** with rotation/revocation in
   [daemon-api-key-auth.md](daemon-api-key-auth.md). Managed platform
   credentials pass through the configured Control Plane cipher and are
   plaintext while in use in the TLS-protected delivery frame, daemon memory,
   and daemon-local `agent.json`; rotation must keep those replicas converged.
