# Daemon groups

**Status:** PR 1 (§6, §8) is **built and deployed** — #1003 folded the pool into the
`member_set` model with zero behavior change, and every #991 test passed unchanged.
PR 2's **mechanism** is built (#1000): org sets exist, the ledger's door is membership
rather than install-wideness, `auth/ok` announces the set, and the daemon's enforcement
predicate reads it. Two pieces of PR 2 are deliberately still open — the console surface,
and the one-action live membership transitions of §3 (what shipped instead is recorded
there). ([k8s-daemon-pool.md](k8s-daemon-pool.md) §14 records the pool as the degenerate
case of what this document generalizes.)

A group makes machines interchangeable _holders_; where a held agent's sessions execute
is the subject of [session-executors.md](session-executors.md), which gives every member
an executor facet so one agent's concurrent sessions can spread across the group.

A _daemon group_ is a named set of daemons within which an agent's duty may be claimed.
The k8s pool is one such group, and since #1003 it is an explicit one: a `member_set` row,
install-wide and org-less, its members every frame-mode Pod of the install. What remains
for this document is the org-scoped half, so that self-hosted installs can form groups out
of ordinary local daemons: point an agent at a group instead of a machine, and the same
ledger, lease exchange, install-on-grant, self-fence, and holder-following delivery
distribute it within the group. For local
daemons this is the cross-machine generalization of the singleton pid lock — today two
local daemons configured with the same bot token fight over the platform API; a group
makes multi-machine failover safe for the first time.

Almost everything here is "reuse X". The one genuinely new thing is the **tenancy axis**
(§3), and it is the reason this is a design document rather than a PR description.

## 1. What is already in place

Every mechanism a group needs landed for the pool and is holder-shaped, not
member-shaped — none of it knows or cares whether the holder is a Pod or a laptop.

`domain/placement.ts` was written with this document in mind. Its contract: _nothing
outside this module may branch on the placement kind; a later kind adds one arm here
and one join in the ledger's predicate, and the callers do not learn about it._ This
design held it to that — and went one step further than the module anticipated: the
`pool` arm was not joined by a `group` arm but **replaced** by a single `set` arm that is
a membership lookup (§3), so the module ended with fewer branches than it started with,
not more. Adding org sets adds none: they are more rows, not another arm.

## 2. Model

One concept: a **member set** — a named set of daemons within which an agent's duty may
be claimed. The pool and a local group are two rows of the same table, distinguished by
tenancy, not by kind:

- **`member_set`** — `(id, orgId, name)`. `orgId` is **nullable, and null means
  cross-org**, never "unassigned": an org-less set is served by org-less daemons and
  holds every organization's agents. The install-wide pool is one such row — **one per
  install**, shared by every organization; there is no per-org pool, and an
  organization that must not share a member gets a `daemon`-placed machine pinned to
  it, not a pool of its own. A local group is a row with an `orgId`: one organization's
  set of its own org-scoped daemons.
- **`member_set_member`** — `(setId, daemonId)`, one daemon in at most one set. Two
  write-time invariants, enforced where the row is written and nowhere else: an
  org-less set accepts only org-less daemons; an org set accepts only that org's
  daemons. Membership is control-plane metadata: an operator records it for org sets
  (console or CLI), and the control plane enrolls an org-less daemon in the org-less
  set itself when it authenticates (§6). It is never negotiated on the wire — the
  daemon is told which set it is in, it does not tell. The one process that opts
  out is an **observer** (#1079): a job registering with `observer: true` on a pool
  identity is admitted on the same TokenReview path and then has that automatic
  membership withdrawn, because eligibility is a `member_set_member` lookup and a
  process whose only job is to sweep must never be granted work. The flag is
  refused on an org-scoped connection.
- **`Agent.placementKind ∈ {daemon, set}`** with `setId` as the ref for `set`. `daemon`
  is unchanged — pinned to one machine, outside the ledger. The `pool` kind #991
  introduced **is gone** as a stored value (§8, landed in #1003): a pool agent is a
  `set` agent whose set is the org-less one. **Third write-time invariant, on the agent:** a `set`-placed
  agent may reference only the org-less set or a set whose `orgId` equals the agent's
  own. Enforced in the same transaction that writes the placement (create, move) — the
  read path never re-checks it. Without this, `mayHold`'s single rule would let org X's
  members claim an org Y agent that had been pointed at X's set.

That is the whole schema. The duty ledger (`duty_group`, `duty_group_member`) is
untouched: a duty group is the _thing claimed_, a member set is the _set that may claim
it_ — the two share a word and nothing else, and the ledger's rows already exist for
every agent regardless of how it is placed.

**Why `daemon` stays its own kind rather than an N=1 set.** A set's meaning is
replaceability — a member dies, the duty moves. A pinned machine has nowhere for a duty
to move; it needs no lease, no fence, no install-on-grant onto itself, and the reaper's
cascade unplaces it rather than re-granting it. Modeling it as a set would add every one
of those rituals for no benefit. A local daemon that wants failover does not become a
set — it **joins** one, and its agents are re-placed onto the set.

## 3. The tenancy axis — the only new thing

Today the ledger admits exactly one kind of claimant: an **install-wide** (frame-mode,
org-less) connection. Every org-scoped connection has its `duties` dropped at the
heartbeat handler, and the three duty request handlers (`duty/claim`, `duty/fetch`,
`duty/release`) answer `SCOPE_DENIED` to it. That door is a deliberate tenancy fence: an
org-scoped connection must never be able to claim, fetch, or release another
organization's work.

A local group's members are org-scoped connections. So the door has to open — but it
opens **narrower**, never wider. The rule from the pool design stands verbatim: _the
tenancy gate widens, never disappears._ Concretely:

- A `daemon`-placed agent's duty may be held by exactly that daemon. Unchanged.
- A `set`-placed agent's duty may be held by exactly the members of that set. For the
  org-less set (the pool) those are the install-wide members — unchanged from today.
  For an org set those are org-scoped connections of that org that an operator enrolled.
- Because of the write-time invariants (§2), those two sentences already imply the
  narrowing: an install-wide member is _not_ eligible for an org set's agent (it can
  never be enrolled in an org set), and an org-scoped daemon is never eligible for a
  pool agent (it can never be enrolled in the org-less set). The pool does not absorb
  groups; groups do not reach the pool.

So `claimScopeOf(daemon)` is no longer a two-valued predicate — PR 1 already made it
"which set is this daemon a member of, if any":

```
member(setId)   — the daemon is in member_set_member for setId
none            — in no set (today's single-org daemon)
```

and `mayHold(agent, claimant)` is **one rule** for every set agent:

```
agent.placementKind = 'set'  ⇒  claimant.setId = agent.setId
agent.placementKind = 'daemon' ⇒ claimant.daemonId = agent.daemonId
```

The tenancy narrowing is not a branch in `mayHold` at all — it lives in the three
write-time invariants (§2): two on `member_set_member` (which daemons a set may
contain) and one on the agent's placement (which set an agent may reference). An org-less set can only ever contain
org-less daemons, so "claimant is in the pool's set" already implies "claimant is
install-wide"; an org set can only contain that org's daemons, so "claimant is in group
G of org X" already implies "claimant is an org-scoped connection of X". The read path
checks membership; the write path guarantees what membership means. That is what makes
one arm sufficient, and it is the argument for this shape over a per-kind branch. The
SQL mirror in the ledger repo (`eligibleAgent` / `noIneligibleAgent`) is a join to
`member_set_member` on `(agent.setId, holder)` — one join, no `CASE` on kind beyond
`daemon` vs `set`.

**What the three handlers do.** The `conn.orgId !== null ⇒ SCOPE_DENIED` line in
`duty-claim.ts`, `duty-fetch.ts` and `duty-release.ts` becomes "resolve this
connection's set; `none` ⇒ `SCOPE_DENIED`". The heartbeat handler forwards `duties`
for any connection in a set. The predicate then does the narrowing per agent, inside
the transaction, exactly as it does today for the pool. An org-scoped member of group G
that sends a `duty/claim` for an agent in another set, or placed on a specific machine,
gets `granted: false` from the same code path a pool member gets it for a
`daemon`-placed agent.

**What the daemon does.** `dutyEnforced()` today reduces to `organizationScope() ===
'frame'` (after #982). It becomes "this connection is in a set", learned from `auth/ok`
— the CP tells the daemon at handshake which set it belongs to, if any, alongside the
lease horizon it already announces (#976).

**Membership changes on a live daemon.** Org-set membership is operator-mutable while
the daemon is connected, so `auth/ok` cannot be the only time it learns its set. The
order of operations is the one the pool drain and the product's agent move already
follow, and for the same reason: **stop the old runtime authority and confirm it stopped,
then commit the new placement — never the reverse.** A transition that publishes a
claimable lease before the old holder has acknowledged it stopped serving lets a
successor win the duty while the old platform connections and turns are still live,
which is the split the ledger exists to prevent. So every membership change is a
two-phase, generation-fenced transition, and while a daemon is entering or leaving a
set nothing may claim what it is giving up or taking on.

- _Removal from a set._ (1) Mark the daemon **leaving**: the ledger stops granting to it
  and stops re-granting its groups to anyone else — the leaving mark is a claim fence on
  exactly those groups. (2) Send a correlated withdrawal request over the existing
  connection carrying the new scope (`none`) and a transition generation; the daemon
  fences every group it holds (the local `duty/revoke` effect — connections and
  schedules stop, workspace and sessions survive) and acknowledges. (3) On the ack,
  commit: delete the membership row, vacate the leases, lift the fence; the sweep
  re-grants to remaining members. If the daemon is unreachable or does not ack, the
  operation does **not** proceed to (3) on a timeout — it waits out the daemon's own
  self-fence horizon (§1, #976), after which the daemon has provably stopped serving
  and the leases have lapsed on their own; then it commits. Successors never receive an
  immediately vacated lease from an unconfirmed leaver.
- _Addition to a set_ of a daemon with no directly placed agents. There is nothing to
  stop, so the transition is one phase: write the row, send the scope update, the daemon
  starts reporting `duties` and claims on its next beat.

**Enrolling a daemon that has directly placed agents.** Nothing happens to them. The
first version of this section claimed the opposite — that a machine which enforces duties
serves only what it holds a lease for, so its pinned agents would go dark the moment the
membership row landed, and therefore the join had to be a per-agent move onto the set.
The premise was wrong. Duty eligibility for a `daemon` placement is
`agent.daemonId = holder`, with **no membership term**: joining a set does not widen who
may hold a pinned agent, so its machine remains the only possible holder. It does enforce
duties now, so it serves that agent through a lease instead of outright — but the lease is
one no peer can take. The join is therefore a single membership row plus the scope update
the daemon already gets, and the agents keep running where they are.

The converse follows from the same predicate: an agent **may** be pinned to a machine
that is in an organization's group. The one refusal that survives is the install-wide
pool, and identity is why — a pool member is a Pod the reconciler retires without notice,
so a pin to one names something that stops existing. That is a statement about
replaceability, not about membership — and the guard reads it as one: an org-less daemon
row, fixed when the row is minted, rather than the membership row that lands at
authentication. A Pod is refused before it enrols, so a pin cannot race the enrolment.

Leaving a set does not move agents by itself: they stay `set`-placed and re-grant to
the remaining members. An operator who wants them pinned back to the leaving machine
moves them explicitly afterwards, which the existing move machinery already does. Both
transitions carry a generation so a stale ack (from a previous attempt, or from a
daemon that reconnected mid-transition) cannot commit the wrong step.

**What shipped, and what the above is still owed.** The mechanism PR (#1000) took the
same safety rule — never commit while the old authority might still be serving — but
paid for it with **preconditions instead of choreography**, so no new wire frame, fence
column, or transition generation exists yet:

- _Join_ needs no transition at all, per the correction above: one membership row, and the
  agents pinned there keep running. It briefly shipped as a per-agent move onto the set —
  detach, re-place, one transaction — which stopped work it had no reason to stop.
- _Leave_ is refused (409) while the daemon holds a **live** duty lease, rather than
  sending a correlated withdrawal and committing on the ack. Draining the daemon, or
  simply letting its leases lapse, is the "stop and confirm" step — a lapsed lease is
  strictly later than that member's own self-fence horizon, which is the same evidence
  the unreachable-leaver path above waits for.
- Either way the daemon relearns its set the one way it ever learns it: the CP closes
  the socket with `1012` and the reconnect's `auth/ok` carries the new membership. Both
  admitted transitions leave nothing running to disturb, so the reconnect costs nothing.
- **Membership is the ledger predicate on BOTH sides of the wire**, and it has to be the
  same one. The daemon gates service on it (`dutyEnforced`) and must gate duty REPORTING
  on it too: the heartbeat digest is what asks for a lease at all. That reporting was for
  a while gated on `organizationMode === 'frame'` instead, which gave the same answer only
  while the install-wide pool was the one set that existed — an org's own machines
  authenticate in `connection` mode, so the moment an org could own a group its members
  went duty-gated and silent, refusing to serve what they held no lease for while never
  asking for one. Every agent on such a member goes dark until the two agree again.

A precondition is only a fence if the state it read cannot change under it, so each one is
taken **inside the transaction that writes**, under a per-daemon advisory lock every writer
of "is this daemon in a set" also takes — enrolment, withdrawal, the `daemon`-placement
guard, and the ledger's two claim paths. Without it a placement reading "in no set" and an
enrolment reading "nothing pinned here" both commit, or a claim lands a live lease on a
member a withdrawal has just decided was idle. Renewal is one of those writers and not
obviously so: it carries no expiry predicate, so it REVIVES every group its holder still
names — which is why the withdrawal also vacates what is left on commit, exactly as the
transition above says. The set's own row carries the second fence:
`FOR SHARE` on every path that adds a reference to it, `FOR UPDATE` on the delete, so a
placement cannot slip past the delete's reference count and be silently `SET NULL`ed.
Membership is likewise re-read once the connection is registered, so a change committing
during a handshake either is seen by that read or finds the connection and closes it.

That is strictly narrower than §3, never wider: every transition it performs is one §3
also permits. What is owed is the leaving half — the one-action drain-and-leave — which is where the
correlated withdrawal request, the leaving fence, and the transition generation earn their
keep, plus the entering fence that would save the extra move on join.

## 4. What does not change

Stated so nobody rebuilds it: install-on-grant, the self-fence, the withdrawal guard,
holder-following delivery, MCP/memory bundle projection, routing-projection
confirmation, proactive re-grant, the drain release, the placement fence — every one of
these is keyed on _the holder_ and already runs for pool members. A group member is a
holder. The two things that read placement kind (`dutyEligibility` and the SQL mirror)
lose the `pool` arm and gain a `set` arm that is one membership lookup; the readers of
those two do not change.

The console's placement selector already lists targets, not machines (#959, #961,
#991). A group is one more entry per set the viewer's org has. On the wire,
`{ kind: 'pool' }` stays accepted as **API sugar** for "the org-less set": the control
plane resolves it at the edge and stores `set`, so the console's existing "Cloud" entry
needs no change and storage has one representation. The sugar becomes ambiguous the
day a second org-less set exists, which is exactly when the console should start naming
the set explicitly.

## 5. Operational prerequisites for a local group

These are the operator's, not the code's:

- **A shared store, if history must follow the duty.** A group runs without one. A duty
  that moves then carries the agent, its workspaces and its placed sessions'
  environments, but each conversation's transcript stays on the member that ran it, and
  a webchat turn that reaches another member is refused rather than answered blind.
  Members that set `store: { "backend": "postgres", "configFile": … }` against one
  database share those rows, the same way pool members do
  ([cloud-data-plane-postgres.md](cloud-data-plane-postgres.md)). Each reports that
  store's identity on register (`RegisterReq.contentStore`, a row the first member on the
  database creates), so a session it records is stamped with its group's set and any
  member reporting the same store reads and continues it; a member on a private store, or
  on another database, does not. A session that ran on
  its holder still keeps its runtime state on that machine; one placed on an executor
  resumes from the successor. On a member's own store, the rows a moved duty leaves
  behind are that member's alone, so its retention sweep ages them out like any others
  even though it no longer serves the agent, and reports each purge receipt; the idle
  close stays with the holder, since it reports to the control plane (#2246).
- **Re-cloneable workspaces.** A GitHub-mode workspace re-materializes on the new holder
  from its repo; a scratch workspace does not follow. This is already true for the pool
  and is documented there; a group inherits the same constraint and the same guidance
  (commit or discard before relying on failover).
- **A member's platform credentials.** Bots are org-scoped and ride the bundle, so a
  group member gets them on install; nothing per-machine is needed.

Managed agent memory is deliberately not on that list. An agent placed on a group keeps
its managed memory in the Control Plane (`memory.home: control-plane`,
[memory-evolution.md](memory-evolution.md) §3.2.1), exactly as a pool agent does: any
member may hold its duty, so a tree on one member's disk would be stranded by the first
failover. The Control Plane resolves that home when an agent is created on a group,
refuses `daemon` there, refuses a daemon-home agent the move onto a group until its home
is switched, and flips existing group agents at boot, after which the member holding
each one copies its tree. An agent pinned to one machine is unaffected and keeps
`daemon` as its default, a group's member included, and so is any agent whose memory
provider is not `managed`. No data-plane database is involved: that home is rows in the
Control Plane's own database.

## 6. Sequencing and size

Two PRs, after #982 lands (it did, as #995 — it and this both edit `dutyEnforced()`).
The first is a refactor with no behavior change; the second is the feature. Splitting
them keeps the pool's just-verified behavior separable from the new one if anything
regresses.

**PR 1 — fold the pool into a member set (§8). Landed as #1003.** Schema: `member_set`,
`member_set_member`, `placementKind` gains `set` and loses `pool`; a migration creates
the one org-less row, rewrites every `pool` agent to `set` + that row's id, and enrolls
every org-less daemon row as its member. `domain/placement.ts` and the SQL mirror
replace the `pool` arm with the membership lookup. `{ kind: 'pool' }` stays as API sugar
at the edge. Every #991 test must pass unchanged — this PR is the proof that the pool
was a set all along. Also: a new org-less daemon row (a Pod that just authenticated)
must be enrolled in the org-less set as part of `upsertOnAuth`, so pool membership stays
automatic; a `daemon`-kind daemon row is never enrolled anywhere by itself.

**PR 2 — org sets (#1000).** The three duty handlers and the heartbeat handler:
`SCOPE_DENIED` becomes "in no set". `auth/ok` announces the daemon's set; the daemon's
enforcement predicate reads it. Nothing in the ledger changes — PR 1 already made it
set-shaped. Org-set CRUD and membership are an org-scoped REST surface
(`/orgs/:orgId/member-sets`), and the daemon read model carries its set. **Shipped as the
mechanism**, with the transition ergonomics reduced to the preconditions §3 records.
The Console exposes group CRUD from Daemons, membership on daemon detail, and one
placement entry per group in every deployment, without a feature flag.

Load-bearing tests, all mutation-checked: an org-scoped member of set G in org X claims
a `set`-placed agent of X in G; the same member is refused a `set` agent of X in another
set, any agent of another org, any pool agent, and any `daemon`-placed agent; a pool
member is refused any org-set agent; the write-time invariants reject an org-less
daemon joining an org set and vice versa; and the pool's existing "never claims a
local-daemon agent" test still holds. Then the same rollout test the pool passed: stop
one member of a local set, and its agents re-grant to another member with no message
sent.

## 7. Rejected

- **`group` as a third placement kind beside `pool`** (the shape an earlier draft of
  this document had). It costs the same as this one — the tenancy distinction moves
  from a write-time invariant to a read-path branch — and buys nothing but avoiding
  §8's migration; it makes a second install-wide pool a schema change instead of a row,
  and it leaves "why is the pool not a row" as a permanent question. The migration is
  small and has #991's tests as its net, so the two-shape version is not worth carrying.
- **`daemon` as an N=1 set** (§2). A pinned machine has no replaceability, so every
  set ritual (lease, fence, install-onto-self) would be pure cost.
- **A daemon in several sets.** Nothing needs it, and it turns "which set's eligibility
  applies" into a policy question. Add if a real case appears.
- **Cross-org sets with an org id** — a set with `orgId = X` that admits another org's
  daemons. That would be a second tenancy model; the org-less set already is the
  cross-org shape, with the org-less identity that makes it safe.
- **Negotiating membership on the wire** (a daemon announcing which set it is in).
  Membership is an operator decision recorded in the control plane; the daemon is told,
  it does not tell. The one exception is automatic pool enrollment on auth (§6 PR 1),
  which is the CP deciding, not the daemon.

## 8. Folding the pool: the migration (applied)

The pool used to exist as `placementKind = 'pool'` on agents and as "org-less daemon
row" on daemons, with no set row anywhere. PR 1 (#1003) made it a set:

1. Create `member_set` and `member_set_member`; insert one org-less row (the pool).
2. `UPDATE agent SET placementKind = 'set', setId = <pool> WHERE placementKind = 'pool'`.
3. `INSERT INTO member_set_member SELECT <pool>, id FROM daemon WHERE "orgId" IS NULL`.
4. Drop `pool` from the `AgentPlacementKind` enum. `setId` is nullable (null for
   `daemon`-kind agents), like `daemonId` is nullable for `set`-kind agents.

Behavior must be identical before and after: the same members hold the same groups at
the same terms. The migration touches no ledger row. It is safe to run under load
because eligibility is re-read on every claim from current placement, and a claim in
flight across the migration sees either "pool agent, install-wide claimant" or "set
agent, claimant in the org-less set" — the same answer.

The daemon needs nothing for PR 1: it still learns "you are install-wide" from
`auth/ok` as today; PR 2 turns that into "you are in set S".

**Rollout ordering.** Old control-plane code does not understand a stored `set`
placement, and new code cannot resolve eligibility before `member_set` exists, so the
migration and the code that reads it must not straddle a rolling deploy of the control
plane. Two answers were acceptable: a coordinated cutover with the control plane
briefly down, or shipping the schema first with dual-read code that treats `pool` and
`set`-of-the-org-less-row as the same eligibility, migrating, then dropping the `pool`
arm in a following release. **The cutover is what shipped** — this is a pre-release
project with a single control-plane replica per environment, so the compatibility
window would have been machinery for a problem that does not exist. The migration
itself is safe under load either way: eligibility is re-read from current placement on
every claim, and a claim in flight across it gets the same answer both ways.
