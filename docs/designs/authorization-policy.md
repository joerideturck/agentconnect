# OSS Authorization Policy

> **Status:** Implemented
>
> **Scope:** Human Control Plane REST, SSE, and bounded daemon-backed reads.

## 1. Goal

Human authorization had three policy locations:

- organization-role guards in `http/rbac.ts`;
- shareable-resource and session predicates in `http/visibility.ts`;
- a route-local session visibility-change predicate.

The OSS policy now converges in `control-plane/src/authorization/policy.ts`.
Routes may keep readable adapters such as `canView`, but every in-memory
decision delegates to one `can(principal, request)` entry point. Prisma list
filters use the colocated `visibilityWhere` projection of the same resource
rule.

This is a behavior-preserving architecture seam except for the intentional
removal of the organization-owner visibility bypass described in section 4.

## 2. Boundary

The request pipeline remains layered:

1. `humanAuth` authenticates a user, personal key, or OAuth principal.
2. `org-scope` verifies path-organization membership, API-key organization
   binding, and OAuth scope confinement.
3. The OSS authorization policy evaluates organization role, resource
   visibility, and session ownership.
4. The handler executes only after the applicable decisions pass.

The policy does not absorb unrelated trust domains:

- daemon and relay WebSocket authentication;
- GitHub repository, git-credential, hook, and review authorization;
- agent-to-agent call policy;
- platform ingress routing;
- daemon reconciliation and other internal unfiltered reads.

Those boundaries have different principals and security invariants. Folding
them into the human Console policy would create a misleading global `can()`.

## 3. Principal, actions, and resources

The current principal is the organization membership context:

```ts
interface ViewCtx {
  userId: string
  role: 'owner' | 'collaborator' | 'viewer'
}
```

The action vocabulary represents the distinct OSS policies that exist today:

| Action                      | Resource facts                     | Baseline decision                                             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `organization.write`        | none                               | owner or collaborator                                         |
| `organization.manage`       | none                               | owner only                                                    |
| `resource.view`             | visibility, Selected audience      | org-visible or explicitly selected                            |
| `resource.edit`             | shareable resource                 | visible and role is not viewer                                |
| `resource.sharing.manage`   | shareable resource                 | same as `resource.edit`                                       |
| `session.view`              | tier, owner identity, identity set | org-visible or identity-owned                                 |
| `session.visibility.change` | tier, owner identity, identity set | identity-owned, or an org owner while the session remains org |

Membership removal uses the target-aware `organization.membership.remove`
action: every role may remove itself, while removing another member requires
the owner role.

The vocabulary can gain finer-grained OSS actions when the product adds a new
role or capability. The principal and resource shapes do not need to change.

## 4. Role and visibility

**Qai fork.** Upstream treats organization ownership as an administrative role,
not a resource-discovery capability ("role never widens visibility"). This fork
adds an owner exception for shareable resources: an owner governs the whole
organization and sees every resource in it.

For shareable resources:

```text
visible =
  principal role is owner
  OR resource is organization-visible
  OR principal is explicitly shared

editable = visible AND principal role is not viewer
```

An organization owner therefore can discover, read, edit and re-share every
resource of the organization, selected or not. A collaborator still needs to be
selected on a restricted resource; a viewer stays read-only.

Session visibility is NOT widened: private sessions follow identity ownership
only, and the owner role grants nothing there (session-visibility.md §5).

Invisible point reads and referenced writes preserve their existing
not-found-shaped responses so the policy does not create a resource-existence
oracle.

## 5. List-query equivalence

Human list queries apply:

```sql
WHERE "orgId" = $orgId
  AND (
    "visibility" = 'org'
    OR "sharedWith" @> ARRAY[$userId]
  )
```

Every human role, including owner, uses this predicate. Only callers that omit
the principal are unfiltered; this is reserved for daemon reconciliation,
placement, and other internal operations that must continue serving active
restricted resources.

The SQL projection and in-memory `resource.view` rule are colocated and covered
by the same truth-table tests. Paginated queries must not post-filter an
already-sized page.

## 6. Audience repair on member removal

`sharedWith` is the complete audience for a restricted resource;
`createdByUserId` remains immutable creation attribution and grants no access.
Removing a member prunes their ID from every Selected visibility carrier before
deleting the membership. If an audience would otherwise become empty, removal
adds a deterministic current organization owner while keeping the resource
Selected. Any member may remove their own membership; removing another member
requires the Owner role.

Owner demotion, removal, and invited-identity role merge first lock the
organization `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, then recheck the actor's membership and any
required owner role before locking the affected memberships. This serializes
competing last-owner transitions without conflicting with ordinary resource
writers' parent `FOR KEY SHARE`. Removal selects its audience-repair member from an
authoritative membership snapshot inside that transaction before scanning
resources. Resource creates and sharing writes hold shared membership locks and
recheck the actor and requested audience members inside their own
resource-write transaction. A queued write therefore cannot persist a departed
stable user ID, and a repair member cannot lose owner status before removal
commits.

## 7. Verification

Focused verification covers:

- the action/role matrix;
- shareable-resource visibility and editing across every role;
- session read and visibility-change semantics;
- equality between human SQL filtering and `resource.view`;
- route-level 404/403 behavior for list, point read, derived credentials,
  referenced writes, usage, SSE, and MCP tool access;
- unchanged unfiltered daemon/orchestration reads.
