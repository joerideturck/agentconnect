 * There was briefly a required/capability split here, on the theory that a scope backing one
 * optional tool should not mark an older installation broken. It did not survive contact: the
 * "required" half was not required either — the app receives and answers messages without
 * several of them — so the line was invented rather than observed, and it bought a second
 * constant, an extra API field, extra console branches, and a message that said six permissions
 * were missing without naming them. One list is both simpler and more honest: these are the
 * scopes AgentConnect needs, an install short of any of them is incomplete, and the console
 * says exactly which to add.
