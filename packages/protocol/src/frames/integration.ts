 * the reconcile snapshot `RegisterOk.integrations[]`). The daemon opens the Socket
 * Mode connection from the delivered config (see slack/connection.ts).
 *
 * SECURITY: `integration/upsert` and `RegisterOk.integrations[]` carry PLAINTEXT
 * platform tokens (botToken/appToken/appSecret). These payloads MUST NEVER be
 * logged — no body dump on decode error, no register/ok snapshot debug dump.
 * CP-owned integrations live only in daemon MEMORY and are re-converged on
 * reconnect; hand-authored agents keep tokens in their own `agent.json` (the
 * same trust boundary as the daemon process).
 *
 * `signingSecret` is intentionally absent: Socket Mode authenticates with the
 * app-level token, so the daemon never needs a signing secret.

 *    the event stream). `botUserId` is optional and lazily resolved by the
 *    daemon via `auth.test` (same as direct) if the sender ever needs it.
 *
 * The direct-mode `appToken` requirement is a cross-field rule with the
