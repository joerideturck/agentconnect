/**
 * The **platform manifest** — §5 of integration-plugin-architecture.md, the one
 * platform-shaped table every host may read BEFORE a dispatch target exists.
 * That is D2's dividing rule for what earns a field here at all: if a host can
 * wait until it holds a connection, an adapter, or a turn, the answer belongs in
 * that host's Layer 1/2 contract or a strategy function, not in the manifest.
 *
 * Promoted from the daemon-local `platforms/manifest.ts` when the relay became
 * the second consumer (stage S3) — the field VOCABULARY is §5's as published,
 * and it lives in `protocol` because every host (daemon, relay, CP, web)
 * already depends on this package for the platform ids the table is keyed by.
 *
 * THE RULE HAS TEETH — it already rejected a field. Status-bar shape ("Slack
 * has an editable session status line; the others answer `/status` on demand")
 * looks exactly like a capability, and is not one: every read is from a turn
 * that already exists, i.e. post-dispatch. A manifest field is earned by a
 * PRE-DISPATCH read, in review, or it is just a capability flag with better
 * branding — the pattern this migration exists to eliminate.
 *
 * So this file is deliberately SMALL and grows one justified field at a time,
 * landing with the branches it retires, never speculatively.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED DEFAULTS ARE THE POINT. Lookup is total: an id this build does
 * not know gets `DEFAULT_MANIFEST`, whose every value is the conservative arm —
 * no authoritative enumeration API is assumed, no bot-sender admission is
 * granted, no bot serves more than one agent. That reproduces the behavior of
 * every branch being replaced (each was written as "Slack does X, everyone else
 * does Y"), and it means an unknown platform degrades quietly instead of taking
 * a Slack-shaped path it cannot serve.
