/**
 * Skill-source routes — the referenced-guard on DELETE and its (orgId, name)
 * lifecycle fence. Agents bind a source by NAME (every enable-ref is
 * "<source>/<skill>" / "<source>/*" / "<source>"), so deleting a source that
 * agents still enable would leave dangling selectors that silently re-bind to any
 * future source recreated under the same name. DELETE must 409 while referenced
 * (same rule as MCP-provider delete), create must refuse a referenced name
 * (name-capture guard), and agent enable-list writes serialize with both.
 *
 * The fence is the (orgId, name) ADVISORY LOCK SCOPE
 * (persistence/skill-source-lock.ts), taken inside each participant's
 * transaction — so it holds across control-plane instances, and these tests
 * simulate "the other instance" by holding the scope from an independent
 * transaction on the shared pool ({@link holdSkillSourceScope}).
 *
 * One skills-specific difference from the MCP-provider fence: a skill-ref has no
 * daemon-local fallback — the in-scope visibility check refuses a NEW ref whose
 * source is unknown, so an agent write serialized after a delete is refused (403)
 * rather than committing a dangling ref. Dangling refs can therefore only predate
 * the fence (or bypass the routes); the capture guard still protects those.
