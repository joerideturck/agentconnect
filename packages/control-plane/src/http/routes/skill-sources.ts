/**
 * `http/routes/skill-sources.ts` (design docs/designs/shared-skills.md §4).
 *
 * CRUD for org-level shared-skills sources. A source records only WHERE skills
 * come from (a bounded public GitHub repository/tree path) plus its numeric
 * repository identity, optional ref, and skill filter — skill CONTENT never
 * touches the CP. The numeric identity is the CP's to resolve, not the client's:
 * projection drops a source without one, so a write that cannot bind it is
 * refused here instead of producing a row that looks enabled and installs
 * nothing (issue #935). The daemon acquires a commit-bound snapshot and installs it
 * with its bundled exact CLI before the ACP host spawns.
 *
 * There is NO secret side-table (unlike MCP providers): skills carry no upstream
 * credential of their own. A PRIVATE repository is admitted only when the org's
 * GitHub App installation covers its owner; the row records `private: true`, and
 * the gitcred broker treats an agent's enabled private sources as its read-only,
 * repository-scoped grant set (github/service.ts), so the daemon acquires it with a
 * short-lived installation token rather than anonymously. The definition is not
 * pushed on its own frame either — it rides INLINE on each enabling agent's
 * AgentSpec.skills (resolved by agentSpecAssembler). So a source change fans out to
 * `agent/upsert` for every agent that references it (§4 trade-off).
