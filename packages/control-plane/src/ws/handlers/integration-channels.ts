/**
 * `integration/channels` handler (per-conversation trigger config).
 *
 * A fire-and-forget EVT (no reply). Slack reports the full membership set; a
 * platform that cannot enumerate its chats reports `authoritative:false`, which
 * upserts observed conversations without deleting older rows. Both forms
 * PRESERVE each stored conversation's operator-chosen trigger. Channel ids/names
 * are control metadata — never message content (§1/§12). Every accepted report
 * also hot-pushes the derived collaboration routes without waiting for reconnect.
 *
 * `removed` is the one way a non-authoritative reporter can DELETE: its omissions
 * carry no meaning, so a conversation it has genuinely left has to be named. It
 * applies alongside the upsert, so one report can both refresh what remains and
 * retire what is gone.
 *
 * Scope check: the integration's owning agent must be SERVED by the reporting
 * daemon — the same `pinned-to-me ∪ duties I hold` union `register/ok.integrations[]`
 * ships under, so a duty holder may write for what it was given and nothing else.
 * A daemon can never write channel rows for another daemon's integration.
