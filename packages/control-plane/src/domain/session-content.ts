/**
 * The ONE answer to "which daemons can serve this session's recorded content"
 * (transcript pages, tool bodies). Both content-read routes resolve their targets here.
 *
 * `SessionMeta.daemonId` names the daemon that FIRST reported the session, and for a
 * self-hosted daemon that is also the only machine holding the rows — its store is local.
 * A cluster pool member is different: its store is the install-wide data-plane Postgres
 * every member shares, so the content outlives the pod that recorded it. So does a
 * self-hosted member of an org group that writes a shared PostgreSQL store: it reports that
 * store on register (`daemon.contentStoreId`), and the members reporting the same one hold
 * the same rows (`MemberSetRepo.sharedStoreMemberIdsOf`). Pool members are
 * bound to a Pod UID and reaped 15 minutes after they go silent, which SetNulls `daemonId`
 * on every session they recorded — so routing by that column alone loses transcripts that
 * are still fully there.
 *
 * Eligibility is a property of the STORE, and of the SESSION, never of the agent:
 *
 * - Not of the agent's placement. It can move into a set, out of one, or between two long
 *   after a session ran; content does not follow it either way. `SessionMeta.contentSetId`
 *   is stamped from the recorder's own membership when the session is first reported, so it
 *   keeps naming the store the bodies went to however the agent is placed later.
 * - Not of the agent's live duty holder. An idle pooled agent holds no lease at all — the
 *   ordinary state — yet its transcripts are exactly as readable as ever, by any member of
 *   the store they were written to.
