/**
 * PgSessionUsageRepo — per-session token accounting for the console usage
 * dashboard (see the `SessionUsage` model + `usage/report` EVT).
 *
 * `record` latest-wins upserts the `(agentId, sessionId)` snapshot AND upserts the
 * session's cumulative tokens/cost plus its observed model into the timeline —
 * both idempotent, so re-sending or racing the same numbers is a no-op. A LATE
 * report still lands its own timeline checkpoint but cannot roll the snapshot back.
 * `aggregate` reports tokens/session-counts from the snapshot but derives every
 * range-scoped COST figure (total, per-agent/model, and the spend-over-time chart)
 * from the timeline by diffing consecutive cumulatives, so the cards and chart agree
 * and pre-window spend is excluded. It is org-scoped through the `agent` relation.
 * Token columns are `Int` per row
 * (a single session won't exceed 2^31), but Postgres `SUM(int)` returns `bigint`;
 * Prisma surfaces these `_sum` values as `number` (safe to 2^53), which is plenty
 * for workspace-wide token totals.
 *
 * COST is the exception to all of that: it is `NUMERIC(38,18)`, it is read out as TEXT,
 * and every diff and sum below runs on integers scaled by that column's scale. Billing
 * reads these aggregates, so no step may round — not through a float, and not through
 * `Prisma.Decimal` either, whose arithmetic rounds to 20 significant digits and would
 * turn an exact `123.123456789012345678` into `123.12345678901234568` on the first
 * subtraction. Scaled `bigint` has no precision setting to get wrong.
