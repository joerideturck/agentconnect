/**
 * Member sets — the named sets of daemons within which an agent's duty may be claimed
 * (docs/designs/daemon-groups.md §2). The install-wide pool is the ONE org-less row; an org's own
 * sets are rows with its `orgId`, created by an operator.
 *
 * Everything tenancy-shaped lives on the WRITE side here. `enrollDaemonInSet` is the only writer
 * of `member_set_member`, and it is where "an org-less set accepts only org-less daemons, an org
 * set only that org's daemons" is enforced — which is precisely what lets the ledger's read path
 * be one membership lookup with no tenancy branch.
 *
 * ## The two fences
 *
 * Every invariant here is a check paired with a write, and both halves have concurrent writers, so
 * each pair needs something to serialize on:
 *
 * - **Per daemon** — {@link lockDaemonMembership}, an advisory transaction lock every writer of
 *   "is this daemon in a set" and every reader that acts on the answer takes: enrolment,
 *   withdrawal, and the ledger's two claim paths. Without it, a claim commits a live lease onto a
 *   member the withdrawal has just decided was idle. The pool-placement guard is not a taker: it
 *   reads the daemon's identity, which no enrolment changes.
 * - **Per set** — the `member_set` row itself, read `FOR SHARE` by everything that adds a
 *   reference to it and `FOR UPDATE` by the delete. Counting references without that lets a
 *   placement land after the count and be silently `SET NULL`ed by the cascade.
 *
 * Both are ordinary Postgres, taken inside the transaction that writes, so they hold across
 * control-plane instances rather than only within one process.
