/**
 * `RelayIngressManager` (shared-bot-relay.md §10 / §12) — glues the CP's HTTP-bot
 * control frames (`rc/bot-assign` / `rc/bot-unassign` / `rc/routes` / `rc/assign`)
 * to the ingest lifecycle, arbitration ({@link BotArbitrationRouter}), and forwarding
 * onto the target daemon (`rd/msg` `im`).
 *
 * Flow: `rc/bot-assign` loads the bot's inbound routing + credentials; inbound
 * arrives via the public Slack or Feishu callback routes, which authenticate,
 * normalize, arbitrate, and forward to the resolved daemon as a pre-addressed
 * `rd/msg(im)`. A daemon that is offline / has no connection here is a TYPED
 * delivery miss → bounded-loss drop + count (never a silent success, §17).
 *
 * Affinity (§10 step 3, the 3-leg dance): on the FIRST route of a (channel, thread)
 * `sessionKey` (or a Switch-agent) the manager REPORTS it to the CP (`rc/thread-assign`);
 * on an un-mentioned follow-up it has no cached affinity for, it PULLS the persisted
 * owner from the CP (`rc/thread-lookup`) rather than dropping the message.
