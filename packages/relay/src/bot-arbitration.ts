/**
 * `BotArbitrationRouter` (shared-bot-relay.md §10) — the relay-side arbitration table
 * for HTTP bots. Holds each assigned bot's attributed routing table (pushed by
 * the CP via `rc/bot-assign` / `rc/routes`) plus live thread affinity, and
 * resolves one inbound message to its target `{ agentId, daemonId, integrationId }`.
 *
 * The ladder mirrors the daemon's local arbitration (routing-table.ts) but over
 * ALREADY-ATTRIBUTED routes, and adapted for the multi-agent ambiguity (all agents
 * answer as one bot user id): channel ownership → thread continuity → keyword
 * (agent slug) → the channel's own default → the group's default agent for a bare
 * @bot / DM. There is NO unscoped mention rule (it would starve keyword
 * disambiguation, §10.4); the bare @bot fallback is the `defaultAgentId` rung instead.
 *
 * Pure data + a pure `arbitrate()` — no I/O, no Slack, no sockets — so it unit
 * tests without a live ingest.
