/**
 * The single unified send tool (session-concept §3). It merges the former
 * `sendPlatformMessage` (post to a platform channel/user) and `messageAgent` (wake a peer
 * agent) into one tool, and also carries SessionTarget replies. Sending is not bound to the
 * platform that triggered the session: an agent may post on its current platform OR any OTHER
 * platform it is connected to. The daemon holds every bot token and picks the connection from
 * `platform` (+ optional `integrationId`); the model never sees a token. The `platform`
 * enum is narrowed at build time to the platforms this agent actually has (absent when the
 * agent has no platform integration — pure A2A / reply still work).
 *
 * There is NO visible in-thread form (send-message-routing-rework.md §2.1/§2.2). To address
 * an agent or a human in the CURRENT thread, the agent writes an ordinary turn reply
 * containing the platform-native mention — that reply already has the right channel,
 * thread, transport scope, streaming lifecycle, and sender identity, so a second sending
 * tool would only create a competing delivery path. This tool is therefore for what the
 * ordinary reply cannot do: a postless agent call, a direct message, a channel-root post,
 * or a parent-session reply. A visible send is always at the channel ROOT.
