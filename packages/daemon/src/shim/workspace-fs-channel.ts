/**
 * The workspace-tree half of the `read` capability: a cluster agent's worktrees live on its sandbox
 * volume, and this is how the daemon's `WorkspaceFs` seam reaches them.
 *
 * It is the same fd-anchored channel the managed memory tree rides — `memory-fs-channel.ts` — with
 * one more primitive (`stat`) and a different tree under the same mount. Reusing it rather than
 * opening a second one is the point: containment on the pod is the descent from an open descriptor,
 * which is stronger than any name check this side could make, and there must be exactly one
 * implementation of it.
 *
 * Paths arrive ABSOLUTE, in the pod's coordinates (`<mount>/worktrees/<sid>`), because that is what
 * the daemon composes and what git in the pod is given. They are turned into mount-relative ones
 * here; anything that is not under the mount is refused before it reaches the wire.
