/**
 * The **integration envelope + opaque config reads** (audit Appendix A class b,
 * stage S3; §6.4 final shape).
 *
 * §6.4 splits an integration into a CORE ENVELOPE core owns and reads
 * (`mode`, `bindRules`, `mutedChannels`, `gated`) and an OPAQUE `config` that
 * only the platform's own module understands. Core reads the envelope straight
 * off the entry; the config is validated against the platform module's own
 * zod schema, resolved through the static registry below — the same
 * one-entry-per-platform shape as `SELF_IDS` here, `ORDERINGS` in
 * message-ordering.ts, and the other §7.4 strategy tables. An unregistered
 * platform, an absent config, or a payload the schema rejects all read as
 * `undefined`, and every consumer fails CLOSED on that (skip the integration,
 * open no connection) — a platform this daemon has no module for cannot be
 * half-served.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS PER-PLATFORM beyond the schema: the bot's own id. §6.4
 * deliberately keeps it OUT of the core envelope because it is the platform's
 * identity vocabulary, not a routing knob — a Feishu bot has an `open_id`, not
 * a user id. So that one read is a registered strategy with a fail-safe
 * default (the `botUserId` name the other three share), which is what the
 * audit's class-b rows ask for: core keeps the envelope, the platform keeps
 * its own words.
