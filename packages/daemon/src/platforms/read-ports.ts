/**
 * **Layer-1 read ports** — which optional facets of the connection contract a
 * platform offers, and how core asks (integration-plugin-architecture.md §7.1 /
 * §7.4, audit Appendix A class a, stage S3).
 *
 * `contract.ts` already declares the optional half of {@link PlatformConnection}
 * — `getThreadReplies`, `openDirectMessage`, `listBotChannels`, … — and the audit
 * calls the `typeof conn?.x === 'function'` probe over them "the sanctioned
 * Layer-1 read-port mechanism". What was missing is the OTHER half of the same
 * question, asked where no connection is in hand yet: *does this PLATFORM offer
 * the port at all?* The MCP tool surface asks it in three places, and each
 * spelled the answer as a platform name:
 *
 *  - which agent-facing attachment tool to inject (`platform === 'slack'` →
 *    `readSlackFile`, `=== 'telegram'` → `readTelegramFile`) — decided at
 *    `session/new` from the agent's CONFIGURED integrations, long before any
 *    connection is resolved;
 *  - which platform a `toUser` direct message defaults to (`?? 'slack'`);
 *  - whether the selected platform can open a DM at all (`!== 'slack'` → throw).
 *
 * TWO ASKS, ON PURPOSE. {@link offersReadPort} probes a live bearer (a
 * connection, or the `MessageGateway` slice the MCP tools hold); the registry
 * below answers for a platform id before one exists. They are not redundant: the
 * probe is the truth about THIS connection, the declaration is what core may
 * assume while building a tool list for an agent whose bots may all be offline.
 * Deciding tool injection by live probe would silently drop `readSlackFile` from
 * a session opened while the socket was reconnecting — a behavior change this
 * refactor is not allowed to make.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED BY ABSENCE, like `messageOrderingFor`. An unregistered platform
 * declares no ports: no attachment tool is injected, no DM is attempted. That is
 * exactly the old `else` arm of every branch above, and it means a new platform
 * degrades quietly instead of inheriting a Slack-shaped path it cannot serve.
 *
 * TOOL NAMES ARE FROZEN. `readSlackFile` / `readTelegramFile` are names agents
 * have learned and examples teach; the injection MECHANISM generalizes, the
 * names do not move. They live in their platform's own module now, which is the
 * whole point — core no longer knows that either name exists.
