/**
 * Slack's **credentialed attachment read**, as an agent-facing tool (§7.1 read
 * port, stage S3).
 *
 * A Slack `url_private` is only fetchable with the bot token, which the agent
 * never holds — so the platform contributes a tool that downloads through its
 * own connection. Core injects it because Slack DECLARES it in
 * `platforms/read-ports.ts`, not because core knows the word "slack".
 *
 * THE NAME IS FROZEN. `readSlackFile` is what agents have learned, what every
 * shared resource_link points at, and what warm ACP sessions already carry in
 * their descriptor list. The injection mechanism generalized; the name did not.
