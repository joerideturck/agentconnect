/**
 * Telegram's **credentialed attachment read**, as an agent-facing tool (§7.1
 * read port, stage S3).
 *
 * A Telegram `file_id` is not a URL at all — resolving it to bytes needs a
 * `getFile` call with the bot token — so the platform contributes a tool that
 * downloads through its own connection. Core injects it because Telegram
 * DECLARES it in `platforms/read-ports.ts`, not because core knows the word
 * "telegram".
 *
 * THE NAME IS FROZEN — see the note on Slack's sibling module.
