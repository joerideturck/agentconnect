/**
 * The web console's **platform-module contract**
 * (integration-plugin-architecture.md §10, stage S3) — published FIRST, with
 * every implementation still in place. Same sequencing as the daemon's Layer-1
 * contract (#525), the relay's two-sided ingress contract (#560), and the CP's
 * provider contract (#565): moving a body while ALSO changing what it can reach
 * is how a file move becomes a silent contract redesign (§16), so the seam
 * lands as types, and the four platforms' wizard panes / settings fragments /
 * marks move against it in their own PRs.
 *
 * WHERE THIS LIVES. §10 keeps modules IN the web tree
 * (`src/components/console/platforms/<id>/`) per D1 — no cross-package React,
 * no Tailwind `@source` bookkeeping — so the contract sits at that directory's
 * root. A types-only file needs no `use client` (type imports are erased at
 * build); the concrete modules inherit the app convention that ModalProvider /
 * the view shells are the client boundary (AddIntegrationModal.tsx:1).
 *
 * THE INSTANCE MODEL. A module is per-platform, stateless, registered once —
 * a bag of React components, pure predicates, copy, and its own typed CP
 * client bindings. Unlike the daemon/relay/CP slots there is no lifecycle:
 * nothing is constructed or started. All wizard/settings STATE lives inside
 * the module's components (today's `useState` blocks move with the JSX that
 * reads them); the few axes the HOST must own — because host-rendered chrome
 * reads them too — are enumerated on {@link WizardHost}.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS HOST-OWNED (§10's chassis list, verified against the monolith):
 *  - the platform picker tiles and their daemon-capability gate
 *    (`daemon.caps.platforms`, AddIntegrationModal.tsx:1205-1216, tiles
 *    :2199-2236; the gate is duplicated verbatim at AgentDetailView.tsx:418-423
 *    with its own tile grid :1534-1568 — the registry replaces both hardcoded
 *    lists, the gate itself stays host);
 *  - the webhook/github exemption from that gate (:1212-1215) — those picks
 *    mint relay/CP-backed triggers, not bot identities, and their whole wizard
 *    sections (:2238-2372, :2373-2821) are core fragments, explicitly NOT
 *    modules of this contract;
 *  - the existing/create mode cards (:2887-2934; the module supplies only
 *    their per-platform copy, {@link WebWizardFacet.identityCards});
 *  - the generic free-bot reuse list (:2935-2988; the module supplies only
 *    the eligibility predicate, {@link WebWizardFacet.freeBotFilter});
 *  - the Bot-identity header and the visibility of that whole identity
 *    chassis (:2867-2883) — a module whose pane REPLACES it (Slack's
 *    built-in/custom fork) publishes visibility and the header's
 *    return-to-built-in action through
 *    {@link WizardHost.setIdentityChrome}, never by reaching into host
 *    chrome;
 *  - the footer bar and its Cancel action (:3758-3771; the module drives the
 *    primary through {@link WizardHost.setFooter});
 *  - the shared-bot toggle widget (:3736-3750) and the error banner
 *    (:3751-3756);
 *  - the platform-switch reset seam: today 20 lines of manual `set*('')`
 *    (:1220-1241, repeated in the caps effect :1246-1265). Under the contract
 *    the host remounts {@link WebWizardFacet.Body} keyed by platformId, so a
 *    module's state resets by construction and the reset list stops being a
 *    cross-platform maintenance point.
 *
 * ONE RESPONSIVE TREE. The wizard renders base mobile classes + `desktop:`
 * variants (:2199, :2888) per the repo's mobile conventions; the contract
 * deliberately has NO mobile axis — no `isMobile` host member, no split
 * component slots — so a module CANNOT fork the wizard into desktop/mobile
 * trees. A fragment whose interaction genuinely diverges calls `useIsMobile()`
 * itself, exactly like today's walkthrough disclosure
 * (AddIntegrationModal.tsx:551-556).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT — §5 manifest values. `displayName`, `regions` (ids,
 * labels, portal hosts), `ingress`, `leaveGranularity`,
 * `membershipEnumeration`, `multiAgentShareable` are cross-host manifest
 * fields per D2, not members here — the same exclusion the CP contract makes.
 * The daemon's S2 manifest (`packages/daemon/src/platforms/manifest.ts`) is
 * deliberately daemon-local; the shared §5 manifest lands in protocol with the
 * web registry, and until then the host literals keep carrying those values
 * (`BOT_PLATFORMS` labels :94-105, `LarkFeishuSwitcher`, `platName`'s chat
 * arms data.ts:1923-1939, the region badge AgentDetailView.tsx:113-121).
 * Where §10's sketch ALREADY mirrors a manifest axis onto the module —
 * `affordances.transport`/`affordances.share` — the mirror is kept, because
 * the wizard needs per-platform COPY and a default rule the pure manifest
 * value cannot carry; the doc on each member names its §5 twin.
 *
 * ALSO DELIBERATELY ABSENT: the sign-in provider catalog
 * (`lib/social-login-providers.ts`, `SocialLoginMark` marks.tsx:280-289) —
 * ids that coincide with chat-platform ids but belong to the OIDC connector
 * axis (audit Appendix D, ambiguous row 8); the core-kind marks (webhook /
 * schedule / dream / playground arms of `PlatformMark`, marks.tsx:217-252);
 * cron/hook targeting (§6.8, core; `CronDto.targetPlatform` is already an
 * open string, api.ts:591); and the playground/webchat/hook session special
 * cases (audit class d).
 *
 * MOCK AND ASSET CARRIERS (audit Appendix D §4). {@link WizardHost.mockMode}
 * exposes the one cross-cutting flag; the per-platform mock FIXTURES
 * (data.ts:1140-1622, data-context.tsx:277-490) and the per-platform CSS
 * tokens/animations + `public/brands/lark.svg` are carriers that move WITH
 * their modules in the move PRs — Tailwind v4 source scanning over the module
 * directories is exactly why D1 keeps modules in this tree (see
 * packages/web/STYLE.md).
